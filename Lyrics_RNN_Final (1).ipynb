tell\\nHow much I meant to you, meant it sincere back then\\nWe had time to kill back then\\nYou ain't a kid no more, we'll never be those kids again\\nIt's not the same, ivory's illegal, don't you remember?\\n\\nI broke your heart last week\\nYou'll probably feel better by the weekend\\nStill remember, had you going crazy\\nScreamin' my name, the feeling deep down is good\\n\\nI thought that I

pleasure\\n\\nWhat if the sky and the stars are for show\\nAnd the aliens are watching live\\nFrom the purple matter?\\nSensei went quiet then violent\\nAnd we sparred until we both grew tired\\nNothing mattered\\nCotton candy, Majin Buu, oh, oh, oh, oh\\nDim the lights and fall into you, you, you\\nMy God, giving me pleasure\\nPleasure, pleasure, pleasure\\nPleasure over matter\\n\\nHey, hey)\\nSince you been gone, I been having withdrawals\\nYou were such a habit to call\\nI ain't myself at all, had to tell myself, Naw\\nShe better with some fella with a regular job\"\\nI didn't wanna get her involved\\nBy dinner Mr. Benjamin was sitting in awe\\nHopped into my car; drove far\\nFar's too close and I remember my memory's no sharp\\nButter knife, what a life, anyway\\nI'm building y'all a clock, stop, what am I, Hemingway?\\nShe had the kind of body that would probably intimidate\\nAny of 'em that were unsouthern, not me, cousin\\nIf models are made for modelin'\\nThick girls are made for cuddlin'\\nSwitch worlds and we can huddle then\\nWho needs another friend? I need to hold your hand\\nYou'd need no other man, we'd flee to other lands\\nGrey matter\\nBlue used to be my favorite color\\nNow I ain't got no choice\\nBlue matter\\nYou're good at being bad, you're bad at being good\\nFor heaven's sakes, go to hell, nah, knock on wood, hey\\nYou're good at being bad You're bad at being good)\\nFor heaven's sakes, go to hell Knock on wood)\\nFor heaven's sakes, go to hell\\nKnock, knock, knock, knock on wood\\nWell, frankly, when that ocean so mu'fucking good\\nMake her swab the mu'fucking wood\\nMake her walk the mu'fucking plank\\nMake her rob a mu'fucking bank\\nWith no mask on and a rusty revolver\n",

ice, new glass\\nNew watch, good times babe\\nIt's good times, yeah\\nShe wash my back three times a day\\nThis shower head feels so amazing\\nWe'll both be high, the help don't stare\\nThey just walk

Xannygnashing\\nCaddysmashing, bratty assy\\nHe mad, he snatched his daddy's Jag\\nAnd used the shit for batting practice\\nAdamant and he thrashing\\nPurchasing crappy grams with half the hand of cash you handed\\nPanic and patch me up\\nPappy done latchkeyed us\\nToying with Raggy Anns and Mammy done had enough\\nBrash as fuck, breachin' all these aqueducts\\nDon't believe us\\nTreat us like we can't erupt, yup\\nPolo sweats and Hermes blankets\\nThem label hoes be stealing my shit\\nAnd all they clothes revealing they tits\\nPills, high enough to touch the rim in that bitch\\nWe party in my living room\\n'Cause father is gone\\nAnd he left me this empire\\nThat runs on its own\\nSo all I got to do is whatever the fuck I want\\nAll we ever do is whatever the fuck we want\\n\\nWe end our day up on the roof\\nI say I'll jump, I never do\\nBut when I'm drunk I act a fool\\nTalking 'bout, do they sew wings on tailored suits\\nI'm on that ledge, she grabs my arm\\nShe slaps my hand\\nIt's good times, yeah\\nSleeve rips off, I slip, I fall\\nThe market's down like  stories\\nAnd some don't end the way they should\\nMy silver spoon has fed me good\\nA million one, a million

                                Bad luck to talk on these rides\\nMind on the road, your dilated eyes watch the clouds float\\nWhite Ferrari, had a good time\\nSweet sixteen, how was I supposed to know anything?)\\nI let you out at Central\\nI didn't care to state the plain\\nKept my mouth closed\\nWe're both so familiar\\nWhite Ferrari, good times\\n\\nStick by me, close by me\\nYou were fine, you were fine here\\nThat's just a slow body\\nYou left when I forgot to speak\\nSo I text the speech, lesser speeds, Texas speed, yes\\nBasic takes its toll on me, 'ventually, 'ventually, yes\\nAhh, on me 'ventually, 'ventually, yes\\n\\nI care for you still and I will forever\\nThat was my part of the deal, honest\\nWe got so familiar\\nSpending each day of the year\\nWhite Ferrari, good times\\nIn this life Life), in this life Life)\\nOne too many years\\nSome tattooed eyelids on a facelift\\nThought you might want to know now)\\nMind over matter is magic, I do magic\\nIf you think about it, it'll be over in no time\\nAnd that's life\\nLove)\\n\\nI'm sure we're taller in another dimension\\nYou say we're small and not worth the mention\\nYoure tired of movin', your body's achin'\\nWe could vacay, there's places to go\\nClearly, this isn't all that there is\\nCan't take what's been given No way)\\nBut we're so okay here, we're doing fine\\nPrimal and naked\\nYou dream of walls that hold us in prison\\nIt's just a skull, least that's what they call it\\nAnd we're free to roam\n",

white\\nIf the ground is black and yellow\\nIt's the same way you showed me\\nNod my head, don't close my eyes\\nHalfway on a slow move\\nIt's the same way you showed me\\nIf you could fly, then you'd feel south\\nUp north's getting cold soon\\nThe way it is, we're on land\\nStill, I'm someone to hold true\\nKeep you cool when it's still alive\\nWon't let you down when it's all ruin\\n\\nJust the same way you showed me, showed me\\nYou showed me love\\nGlory from above\\nRegard, my dear\\nIt's all downhill from here\\n\\nIn the wake of a hurricane\\nDark skin of a summer shade\\nNosedive into flood lines\\nTall tower of milk crates\\nIt's the same way you showed me\\nCannonball off the porch side\\nOlder kids trying off the rooves\\nJust the same way you showed me You showed)\\nIf you could die and come back to life\\nUp for air from the swimming pool\\nYou'd kneel down to the dry land\\nKiss the earth that birthed you\\nGave you tools just to stay alive\\nAnd make it out when the sun is ruined\\n\\nThat's the same way you showed me, showed me\\nYou showed me love\\nGlory from above\\nRegard, my dear\\nIt's all downhill from here\\n\\nRemember life, remember how it was\\nClimb trees, Michael Jackson, all ends here\\nSay what up to Matthew, to Shoob\\nSay what up to Danny\\nSay what up to life immortality\\nBending up my Nikes\\nRunning out of melpomene, nicotine\\nStealing granny cigs Take it easy)\\nGimme something sweet\\nBitch, I might like immortality\\nThis is life, life immortality\n",

of that acid\\nForm me a circle, watch my Jagger\\nMight lose my jacket and hit a solo, one time\\nWe too loud in public, them police turned down the function\\nNow we outside and the timing's perfect\\nForgot to tell you\\nGotta tell you how much I vibe with you\\nAnd we don't gotta be solo\\nNow stay away from highways\\nMy eyes like them red lights\\nRight now, I prefer yellow\\nRedbone, so mellow\\nFuck 'round, be cutting you\\nThink we were better off solo\\nI got that act right in the Windy City that night\\nNo trees to blow through, but blow me and I owe you\\nTwo grams when the sun rise\\nSmoking good, rolling solo\\nSolo Solo), solo Solo)\\nSsolo Solo), ssolo Solo)\\n\\nIt's hell on Earth and the city's on fire\\nInhale, in hell, there's heaven\\nThere's a bull and a matador dueling in the sky\\nInhale, in hell, there's heaven\\nOh, oh, oh, oh\\nOh, oh, oh, oh\\nSolo\\nSolo\\nSolo\\nSolo\\n\\nI'm skipping showers and switching socks, sleeping good and long\\nBones feeling dense as fuck, wish a nigga would cross\\nAnd catch a solo, on time\\nWhite leaf on my boxers, green leaf turn to vapors for the low\\nAnd that mean cheap, 'cause ain't shit free and I know it\\nEven love ain't, 'cause this nut cost, that clinic killed my soul\\nBut you gotta hit the pussy raw, though\\nNow your baby mama ain't so vicious\\nAll she want is her picket fence\\nAnd you protest and you picket sign\\nBut them courts won't side with you\\nWon't let you fly solo, yeah\\nI wanted that act right in Colorado that night\\nI brought trees to blow through, but it's just me and no you\\nStayed up 'til my phone died\\nSmoking big, rolling solo\\n\\nIt's hell on Earth and the city's on fire\\nInhale, in hell, there's heaven\\nThere's a bull and a matador dueling in the sky\\nInhale, in hell, there's heaven\\nOh, oh, oh, oh\\nOh, oh, oh, oh\\nSolo\\nSolo\\nSolo By myself)\\nSolo\\nSolo\\nSolo\\nSolo\\nSolo\n",

homeless sometimes, I've\\nBeen living in an idea\\nAn idea from another man's mind\\nMaybe I'm a fool\\nTo settle for a place with some nice views Nice views)\\nMaybe I should move, settle down\\nTwo kids and a swimming pool\\nI'm not brave\\nI'd rather live outside\\nI'd rather live outside\\nI'd rather go to jail\\nI've tried hell\\nIt's a loop) What would you recommend I do?\\nThe other side of the loop is a loop)\\nThis, this fe—, this feel, this feel, this feels\\nThis feels how molly must feel\\nThis feels how molly must feel\\nHow molly must feel\\nThis feels how molly must feel\\nHow

I'm like\\nIt's just a fond farewell\\nBrave)\\n\\nSpeaking of nirvana, it was there\\nRare as the feathers on my dash from a phoenix\\nThere with my crooked teeth and companion sleeping, yeah\\nDreaming a thought that could dream about a thought\\nThat could think of the dreamer that thought\\nThat could think of dreaming and getting a glimmer of God\\nI be dreaming of dreaming a thought\\nThat could dream about a thought\\nThat could think of dreaming a dream\\nWhere I cannot, where I cannot\\n\\nLess morose and more present\\nDwell on my gifts for a second, a moment\\nOne solar flare, we're consumed\\nSo why not spend this flammable paper on the film that's my life?\\nHigh flights, inhale the vapor, exhale once and think twice\\nEat some shrooms, maybe have a good cry about you\\nSee some colors, light hang glide off the moon\\nIn the dark)\\nIn the dark)\\nI'd do anything for you\\nIn the dark)\\nI'd do anything for you\\nIn the dark)\\nI'd do anything for

godspeed, glory\\nThere will be mountains you won't move\\nStill, I'll always be there for you\\nHow I do\\nI let go of my claim on you\\nIt's a free world\\nYou'll look down on where you came from sometimes\\nBut you'll have this place to call home always\\n\\nThis love will keep us through blinding of the eyes\\nSilence in the ears, darkness of the mind Until it's time)\\nThis love will keep through blinding of the eyes Oh)\\nSilence in the ears, darkness of the mind Oh)\\nThis love will keep us through blinding of the eyes Oh, it's 'til it's time we die)\\nSilence in the ears, darkness of the mind\\n\\nOh, oh\\nI'll always love you\\nUntil the time we die\\nOh, oh\n",

out\\n\\nI'm about to drive in the ocean\\nI'ma try to swim from somethin' bigger than me\\nKick off my shoes\\nAnd swim good, and swim good\\nTake off this suit\\nAnd swim good, and swim good, good\\n\\nGot some pretty good beats on this s CD, yeah\\nMemory seats I'm sittin' on stay heated Yeah)\\nI woulda put tints on my windows, but what's the difference?\\nIf I feel like a Ghost, no Swayze\\nEver since I lost my baby\\n\\nI've had this black suit on\\nRoamin' around like I'm ready for a funeral Wow)\\nOne more mile 'til the road runs out, out\\n\\nI'm about to drive in the ocean\\nI'ma try to swim from somethin' bigger than me\\nKick off my shoes\\nAnd swim good, and swim good\\nTake off this suit\\nAnd swim good, and swim good, good\\n\\nI'm goin' off Oh, my pretty love)\\nDon't try stopping me\\nI'm goin' off Throw me a line)\\nDon't try saving You broke my heart)\\nNo flares You broke my heart)\\nNo vest You drove my love)\\nAnd no fear\\nWaves are washin' me out\\n\\nI'm about to drive in the ocean Drive in the ocean, yeah, yeah)\\nI'ma try to swim from somethin' bigger than me Bigger than me)\\nKick off my shoes Good)\\nAnd swim good, and swim good

low that I can admit\\nWhen I hear that another kid is shot by the popo\\nIt ain't an event no more\\nSo low that no more high horses, so hard to wear Polo\\nWhen I do, I cut the pony off\\nNow there's a hole where there once was a logo, how fitting\\nSo low that I can give a fuck about what is trending\\nTryna cut down on my spending\\nRegardless of winning, instead of pretending\\nAnd bending over backwards\\nOver half of these hoes had work done\\nSayin' they want something real from a man\\nJust saying it, we being real persons\\nI hate that it's like this, I feel for you, ant\\nI don't know what it's like with a skirt on\\nSo pardon me if I am being insensitive\\nBut darling, this only worsens\\nSo low my halo stay way low, it feels like it's bent\\nSo low that when they throw pussy or pesos\\nDon't pay no attention to it\\nSo low that I am no rookie, but feel like a kid\\nLookin' at the other kids\\nWith astonishment while I'm on punishment\\nWatchin' the summer come close to an end\\nAfter twenty years in, I'm so naive I was under the im—\\n'Pression that everyone wrote they own verses\\nIt's comin' back different and, yeah, that shit hurts me\\nI'm hummin' and whistlin' to those not deserving\\nI've stumbled and lived every word, was I working just way too hard?\n",

Beverly Hills\\nDomesticated paradise, palm trees and pools\\nThe water's blue, swallow the pill\\nKeepin' it surreal, whatever you like\\nWhatever feels good, whatever takes your mountain high\\nKeepin' it surreal, not sugarfree\\nMy TV ain't HD, that's too real\\nGrapevine, mango, peaches, and limes, the sweet life\\n\\nThe sweet life, sweet life\\nSweet life, sweet life\\nThe sweet, sweet, sweet, sweet life\\nSweet life, the sweet life\\nSweetie pie\\n\\nYou've had a landscaper and a house keeper since you were born\\nThe starshine always kept you warm\\nSo why see the world, when you got the beach?\\nDon't know why see the world, when you got the beach\\nThe sweet life\\n\\nThe best song wasn't the single\\nBut you couldn't turn your radio down\\nSatellite need a receiver, can't seem to turn the signal fully off\\nTransmitting the waves\\nYou're catching that breeze 'til you're dead in the grave\\nBut you're keepin' it surreal, whatever you like\\nWhatever feels good, whatever takes your mountain high\\nKeepin' it surreal, not sugarfree\\nMy TV ain't HD, that's too real\\nGrapevines, mango, peaches, and lime, a sweet life\\n\\nA sweet life\\nA sweet life, yeah\\nA sweet life, a sweet life\\nA sweet life\\nLive and die in the life\\n\\nYou've had a landscaper and a house keeper since you were born Yeah)\\nThe starshine always kept you warm\\nSo why see the world, when you got the beach?\\nDon't know why see the world, when you got the beach?\\n\\nAnd the water is exactly what I wanted Ah)\\nIt's everything I thought it would be Thought it

fuckin' fast year flew by\\nThat's a pretty long third gear in this car\\nGlidin' on the \\nThe deer run across, kill the headlights\\nPretty fuckin', underneath moonlight now\\nPretty fuckin', sunrise in sight\\nIn comes the morning, haunting us with the beams\\nSolstice ain't as far as it used to be\\nIt begins to blur, we get older Blur, hey)\\nSummer's not as long as it used to be\\nEveryday counts like crazy Smoke, haze, wait)\\nWanna get soaked?\\nWanna film a tape on a speed boat?\\nWe smell of Californication Strike a pose)\\nEverything grows in the Congo\\nEverything grows Ooh)\\nCan you come when I call again?\\n\\nOn comes the evening, gold seeking ends\\nPiece in my hand worth twice than a friend\\nAnd two limbs over shoulder, carried away\\nBecause I'm stronger and the Congo is dim Smoke)\\nIn comes the morning, ah Smoke)\\nIn comes the morning, ah Haze)\n",

natural\\nAnd I think you made for the life I lead\\nI'm not fake patient, I don't fake sick, huh\\nThat kinda coffin don't need lean\\nRest in peace\\nGot this lust for life in me, yeah\\nHorny for the game, uh\\nFirst they kiss, then they bite soft, uh\\nThen that bitch wanna play it off, huh\\nFuck it, I'm pretty still in a pit of snakes\\nWhile serpents shake some brand new scales\\nI need a new face, I'm tired of these weirdos\\nActing familiar, took all the rock\\nAnd turned it to pop, he think that he Elvis\\nAnd he ungrateful, they don't say thank you\\nThey don't say grace, not even for meals, not even for millions\\nFuck it, I'm pretty still, look at my deal\\nRichard Mille, look at my ears, flooded with diamonds\\nLook at my skills, running through blocks like ers\\nFortynine diamonds, stuffed in my bracelet\\nThat cost a whop, that cost a whopper\\nAnd it ain't new, I had a knot at John Ehret in my locker\\nPretty still, it ain't no pretty pill\\nIt's either real or real\\nReal easy on the eyes, green like a soccer field\\nSkin hot when they tried me like them poppers feel\\nHands shaking, norepinephrine levels skyrocket, fuel\\nRocket\\n\\nQuit being violent with me Yeah, why, why)\\nQuit being violent with me\\nQuit being violent with me\\nYou make me violent\\n\\nMy room, my room, my room with me\\nEvery night you were in my room\\nMy room, my room with me\\nI guess I can't state my feelings too soon\\nI don't know you\\nAnd I can't put no threats in the air\n",

we're getting older, baby\\nDon't have much longer, baby\\nWhy am I preaching\\nTo this choir, to this atheist?\\nJust like mine, versions of these belong to you\\nAfter a while, they're keeping me close to you\\nJust like me, they long to be close to you\n",

faith\\nBut you must believe in something, something, something\\nYou gotta believe in something, something, something\\n\\nI still believe in man\\nA wise one asked me why\\n'Cause I just don't believe we're wicked\\nI know that we sin, but I do believe we try\\nWe all try, the girls try, the boys try\\nWomen try, men try\\nYou and I try, try\\nWe all try\\n\\nI don't believe in time travel\\nI don't believe our nation's flag is on the moon\\nI don't believe our lives are simple\\nAnd I don't believe they're short, this is interlude\\nI don't believe my hands are cleanly\\nCan't believe that you would let me touch your heart\\nShe didn't believe me when I said that I lost my faith\\nYou must believe in something, something, something\\nYou gotta believe in something, something, something, oh, oh\\n\\nI still believe in man Oh, oh)\\nA wise one asked me why Oh, oh)\\n'Cause I just don't believe we're wicked Wicked)\\nI know that we sin, but I do believe we try Try, try)\\nWe all try, the girls try, the boys try\\nWomen try, men try Every girl tries)\\nYou and I try Every boy tries), try\\nWe all try\\n\\nTry to believe\\nTry Just try)\\nTry to believe, try to

daylight fell\\nSangria in a canteen\\nTalking to myself I can't remember)\\nThis tattoo on my left hand\\nIs turning purpleish blue\\nDaydreams of the romance\\nDaydreams of you You)\\nMy pretty woman in a ballgown\\nI'm Richard Gere in a tux\\nGetting married in a courthouse\\nWriting vows in a rush\\nMaking out before the judge\\nWith my teenage wife\\nGot a wedding band done\\nThat I just might die with\\n\\nIt's an American wedding\\nThey don't mean too much\\nBut we were so in love\\nWe had an American wedding\\nNow what's mine is yours\\nThat's American law\\n\\nMRS dot Kennedy\\nShe signed her name in pen Oh)\\nIn the fancy, fancy cursive Oh)\\nThen turned her term papers in Oh, oh)\\nA thesis on Islamic Oh)\\nVirgin brides and arranged marriage Ah, ah)\\nHijabs and polygamist husbands\\nThose poor unAmerican girls\\nAfter school she ran to me\\nJumped in my .\\nThis is the home of the brave, land of the free\\nBut your parents still didn't know Oh)\\nShe said, I've had a hell of a summer\\nSo, baby, don't take this hard\\nBut maybe we should get an annulment\\nBefore this goes way too far\" Oh)\\nIt's just an American wedding\\nThey don't mean too much\\nThey don't last enough\\nWe had an American wedding\\nNow what's mine is yours\\nAmerican divorce\\n\\nWell, you can have my Mustang\\nThat's all I've got in my name\\nBut Jesus Christ, don't break my heart\\nThis wedding ring won't ever wipe off\\nBut if you stay\\nOh, if you stay Stay)\\nYou'll probably leave later, anyway\\nIt's love made in the USA\\n\\n\\nDon't let 'em front you, they sayin' you can't move\\nWithout 'em, fuck 'em, I tell 'em this ain't new\\nWe been some hustlers since it began, dude\\nAin't gon' be trippin' over some bitchass dude\\nThey so vain, I tell 'em this ain't you\\nYou could get sensitive, but this shit ain't true\\nThese niggas can't do nothin' that I can't do\\nThat she can't do, that he can't do\\nThat you can't do, that we can't do\\nMan, I had a

when I was convinced\\nThat this was much more to you than some some night shit\\nI know you don't need me right now\\nAnd to you, it's just a late night out\\n\\nBitches, nigga, all the bitches in the neighborhood wanna fuck you, nigga\\nThey told me\\nI used to fuck with all of 'em\\nYeah, I ain't got bitches no more\\nBut now I don't care about bitches like that, my nigga, that shit—\\nJasmine fucking wrecked my heart, I don't even know how to feel about bi—\n",

someone else\\nBe yourself, be secure with yourself\\nRely and trust upon your own decisions\\nOn your own beliefs\\nYou understand the things that I've taught you\\nNot to drink alcohol, not to use drugs\\nDon't use that cocaine or marijuana, because that stuff is highly addictive\\nWhen people become weedheads\\nThey become sluggish, lazy, stupid, and unconcerned\\nSluggish, lazy, stupid, and unconcerned\\nThat's all marijuana does to you, okay? This is mom\\nUnless you're taking it under doctor's, um, control\\nThen it's regulated\\nDo not smoke marijuana, do not consume alcohol\\nDo not get in the car with someone who is inebriated\\nThis is mom, call me, bye\n",

precious\\nThen\\nI'm still kicking\\nI'm daydreaming on a strawberry swing\\nThe entire Earth is fighting\\nAll the world is at its end\\nJust in case an atom bomb\\nComes falling on my lawn\\nI should say and you should hear\\nI've loved\\nI've loved the good times here\\nI've loved our good times here\\n\\nSay hello, then say farewell\\nTo the places you know\\nWe are all mortals, aren't we?\\nAny moment this could go\\nCry, cry, cry, oh\\nEven though that won't change a thing\\nBut you should know, you should hear\\nThat I have loved\\nI have loved the good times here\\nAnd I will miss our good times here\\n\\nSpaceships are lifting off\\nOf a dying world\\nAnd millions are left behind\\nWhile the sky burns\\nThere wasn't room for you and I\\nOnly you, goodbye\\nGoodbye\\n\\nAh, now the sky could be blue, I don't mind\\nWithout you, it's a waste of time\\nCould be blue, I dont mind\\nWithout you, it's a waste of time\\nThe sky could be blue, could be grey\\nWithout you, I'm just miles away\\nThe sky could be blue, I don't mind\\nWithout you, it's a waste of time\\n(alarm clock*)\n",

aware\\nOf each other's forms still and in full strides\\nJust the same\\nKeeping us warm\\nWalking in straight lines\\nTalking to sleep at night\\nCoddled and pacified\\nBy versions of mothers\\n\\nIt's all new to me\\nIt's all new to me\\nHaving you around\\nIt's all new to me\\nIt's all new to me\\nHaving you 'round the Higgs\\n\\nWhat if we decide to live by choice?\\nAll this time I knew\\nThat average was something to fall back on after genius ends\\nI watch video; only difference is flattened and remiss\\nSparks of lightning storm behind wet faces\\nSlipped my pants back on and rewind it backward more\\nThe tape stopped before I was back alone\\n\\nI'll be back before\\nThe street lights on, before the daylight's gone\\nI was spoiled by lavish thoughts\\nThey don't compare, no, not at all\\nAnd had this been the past I might not know\\nWhat to do with all\\nOf what you showed\\nWhat you give, my words can't hold\\nAnd if acts of God breaks us apart\\nLeast we did ours\\n\\nTurn back, turn back\\nTurn back, turn\\nBack, turn back, turn\\nIf you've never been in love\n",

feel\\nSometimes it's hard to tell you so\\nYou may not be in the mood to learn\\nWhat you think you know\\nThere are times when I find\\nYou wanna keep yourself from me\\nWhen I don't have the strength\\nI'm just a mirror of what I see\\n\\nBut at your best, you are love\\nYou're a positive motivating force within my life\\nIf you ever feel the need to wonder why\\nLet me know, let me know\\nLove\\n\\nWhen you feel what you feel\\nIt's hard for me to understand\\nSo many things have taken place before this love affair began\\nBut if you feel more like I feel\\nConfusion can give way to doubt\\nFor there are times when I fall short of what I say\\nWhat I say I'm all about, all about\\n\\nBut at your best, you are love\\nYou're a positive motivating force within my life\\nShould you ever feel the need to wonder why\\nLet me know, let me know\\nLove\\n\\nWait, waiting)\\nLet me know\\nYou niggas goin' in)\\nTell me what it is Fuck it)\\nWhat it is, no need to make believe\\nLook beyond your world\\nTry to find, find a place for me\\n\\n'Cause when you're at your best, you are love\\nYou're a positive motivating force within my life\\nShould you ever feel

need\\nMight be what I need\\nSaid you wanna hurt me now\\nYou can't hurt me now\\nThat might be what you need\\n\\nWhat it means to be alive on this side\\nSaid you wanna kill me now)\\nOn this side\\nDon't let me down)\\nOn this side\\nDown, down)\\nFuck the other side\\nI'm on this side\\nI'm on this side\\nI'm on this side\\nHow it feels to have arrived\\nI'm inside\\nI'm inside\\nThose are my niggas for life\\nMothers of us, be kind\\nTo the fathers on whom we rely\\nFathers of us, be kind\\nTo the mothers on whom we rely\\nAhhah, ahhah\\nAhhah, ahhah\\nAhhah, ahhah\\nAhhah, ahhah\\nAhhah\\n\\nWe know you're sugar\\nWe know you're sweet like a sucker\\nPretty sweet\\nPretty sweet\n",

Facebook arrived and, uh\\nShe wanted me to accept her on Facebook\\nAnd I don't want it, because I was, like, in front of her\\nIn front of her, and she told me, like, Accept me on Facebook\"\\nIt was virtual, means no sense\\nSo I say, I'm in front of you, I don't need to accept you on Facebook\"\\nShe starting to be crazy\\nShe thought that because I didn't accept her, she thought I was cheating\\nShe told me like, uh, It's, it's over, I can't believe you\"\\nI said, Come on, you're crazy, because like, yeah\\nI'm in front of you, I'm every day, here in your house\"\\nThat's, it means, like, it's jealousy, pure jealousy\\nFor nothing, you know?\\nVirtual thing\n",

cold water\\nNow it's mosh pits and wet tits\\nI think I need a cold shower\\nCool waters\\nAfrican girl speaks in English accent\\nLikes to fuck boys in bands\\nLikes to watch Westerns\\nAnd ride me without the hands\\nShow me her passport\\nShe's on her own tour\\nBut you're beautiful to me, ooh\\nWave 'em high, girl, to the sky\\nBut you're beautiful to me, oh\\nLive in the clouds\\nWave 'em high, girl, to the sky\\nBut you're beautiful to me\\nLife in the clouds\\nKeep em high, y'all\\nBeautiful stars\\nIn the sky\\n\\nMonks in the mosh pit\\nStage diving Dalai Lama\\nFeet covered in cut flowers\\nThey mosh for enlightenment\\nClean chakra, good karma, oh\\nOne with the water\\nIndian girl sleeps above the temple\\nPlanning a runaway, young at heart\\nYou found a boyfriend\\nAnd now you wanna get away, get away\\nJust a virgin lover on a getaway, get away\\nAnd at sunset they're gonna try and get away, get away\\nAbhayamudra\\n\\nI never ask for much\\nBut please keep up lover\\nWe've got no choices left\\nThe running's fast\\nRun, run, run, run\\nYou're beautiful to me\\nRun, run, run, run, you'd better run\\nYou mean so much to me\\nIn my world, my world\\n\\nWe made it safely\\nEven with your father's army trailing us\\nWe escaped him\\nEven with his archers' bows at our backs\\nWhat a great escape\\nBut there's a long way still, in fact\\nWe're lost in a jungle underneath these clouds\\nThere's a monsoon that never ends\\nA coke white tiger woke us from our slumber\\nTo guide and protect us til the end\\n\\nWe're in the clouds\\nWave 'em high now, to the sky\\nBut you're beautiful to me, oh\\nKeep 'em high, y'all, show you right\\nBut you're beautiful to me, oh Right)\\nBeautiful\n",

bitches wanted\\nI couldn't play guitar like Van Halen\\nHad no secret chords like Saint David\\nBut you still came around, ate your lunch with me\\nUsed to park your car to try the bus with me\\nBut I would say, Girl, don't be dumb—\\nI'm riding shotgun\"\\n\\nWe could go to my house after school\\nAfter school, after school\\n'Cause my dad don't clock off 'til late\\nOff 'til late, off 'til late\\nWe could kick it in the living room\\nLooking through my whole vinyl collection\\nAnd you could teach me how to slow dance or something\\nAnd I'ma give you chills, harmonizing to Otis, Isley, Marvin\\n\\nAnd every time somebody ask me\\nIf I sing songs to get at women\\nI say, Yeah,\" they say, No fair, no fair, it's cheating\"\\nI say, Shit, oh well, oh well,\" ha\\nAnd every time a nigga ask me\\nIf I sing songs to get at women\\nI say, Yeah,\" they say, No fair, no fair, it's cheating\"\\nI say, Boy, don't judge, 'cause, hell, if you were me...\"\\n\\nYou'd be singin' to her\\nLike, Lada, dadada\\nLada, dadada\\nLada, dadada\"\\n\\nNow I'm in the lab, always working late\\nAlways sleeping past the breakfast she makes\\nShe used to stop by, come and holler at me\\nPut her purse down, and try to battlerap me\\nShe don't do that no more\\nNo more, no more\\nDon't even listen to the songs I record\\nBut she be banging that Drake in my car\\nI'm so far gone\\nShe stay blasting Trey and his songs\\nAll damn day long\\nIt's like she never heard of me, heard of me\\n\\nNow, every time somebody ask me\\nIf I sing songs to get my women\\nI say, Nah,\" they say, Okay, I don't believe it\"\\nI say Nope, I swear, I never do it\"\\nAnd every time a nigga ask me\\nIf I sing songs to get at women\\nI say, Nah,\" they say, Who do you think you kidding?\\nI know you, you stole my girlfriend\"\\nAh, ah\\nOoh, ooh, ah) Ooh, ah\\nYeah\\nFair enough\\n\\nFair enough\\nYou see, I just don't play fair\\nBut it's fair enough\\n'Cause your girl broke my heart in half\\nAh, ah\\nI'm singing, Lada, dada\" bout heartbreak\\nAnd now, I'm singing, Lada, dada\" 'bout love lost\\n\\nOoh, oohooh\\nOohoohooh, ooh\\nOohoohooh, ooh, oohooh\\nOohoohooh, ooh, oohoohooh, ooh\\nOohoohooh, ooh, oohooh, ooh, oohooh, ooh\\n\\nDamn\\nHaha\\nI'm saying though, like...\\nAll I write is love songs\\nI mean, I try\\nI come to the studio\\nIyou know what I do\\nWhat you think I do it for? Huh?\\nYeah, uhhuh\\nBut you ain't listening, never\\nBut if you were...\\nMight bug with it\\nHaha, yeah\\nAll these songs for women\\nSongs for women\\nSongs for you, baby\\nFor you\n",

where the fields went down in flames\\nWe could put a hole in the ground\\nThrow seeds and dance for rain\\nIt takes a mind to worry\\nA conscience to feel ashamed\\nBut there's no place to hide out here\\nThese skies are filled with planes\\n\\nAnd both our hands are filthy\\nPointing up at the moon\\nAll tonight, I'll hold you close, close enough to bruise\\nHope a garden grows where we danced this afternoon\\nHope our children walk by spring when flowers bloom\\nHope they'll get to see my color\\nKnow that I've enjoyed sunshine\\nPray they'll get to see me, me wither When I was young)\\nSee me wither When I was young)\\n\\nKnow that—Me)\\nEnjoyed sunshine When I was young)\\nYou know it happens all—Me)\\nKnow that I've enjoyed sunshine Me)\\nYou know it happens all—Me)all the time Me)\\nYou know it happens all—Me)all the time Me)\\nWhen I was young Me, me)\n",

Slauson Ooh)\\nI'm bikin' uphill and it's burnin' my quads Obstacles)\\nI'm bikin' downhill and it sound like a fishin' rod\\nSavage, I'm bikin', yeah\\n\\nTransition lightning Ascending)\\nAshes and remnants of ballers\\nBody that's gutted\\nA Bentley that used to be flawless\\nI'm high up, the raindrops keep falling\\nScattered, the showers\\nDon't scaffold the towers\\nI'm up, mom, I promise\\nIn class with the honors\\nNo cheat like I'm honest\\nAnd how did I become so accomplished?\\n'Cause I don't see foes Foes)\\nI just see a code Code)\\nI just see a hole\\nChinks in your armor\\nLike Pac in the Hummer\\nLike Jigga in summer\\nLeft the house like Obama\\nHit the road like a runner\\nHit the road like Road Runner\\nI'm biking, I'm biking, I'm biking\\nI don't get weak in the knees\\nHundreds spread out like a fan\\nVert feel like some Gucci sandals\\nOpen the sky, get a handful\\nTorso marked up like a vandal\\nHow you not fuckin' with cash?\\nGod gave you what you could handle\\nGave you what you could handle\\nI got the grip like the handle\\nAnd I'm bikin'\\nI'm bikin' with me and my Daniel\\nHades got the angels\\nTV's got the angles\\nI'm brakin'\\n\\nGot, got me fucked up\\nGot a milliondollar bike\\nGot a milliondollar bike\\nGot, got me fucked up\\nGot me fucked up, up\\nMilliondollar bike\\nGot, got me fucked up, up\\nMilliondollar bike\\nGot, got

ice\\nMy soul glow with the low cut, no jheri curl, Jerry Rice\\nBoogie board on the rip tide\\nParasail and deep dive, won't think twice\\nYour little baby bone boy killin' me\\nSwearing he's grown when he got that steel\\nBut he ain't swam with that blue whale\\nI ain't swam with that ho neither, Earl said that world real\\nSit back and watch the water, hope the monster don't wag his tail\\nAnd send that big wave over while I'm showin' off my pirate grill\\nTo the baddies walkin' by me, showin' skin because it's nothing\\nMy little brother servin' molly 'cause that bill due Monday\\nAnd my passport's buried and my home town flooded\\nWith just a little bit of water, but my shoes still muddy\\nAnd if I ever have a daughter, I wonder what I could call her?\\nNine months after I fuck on the beach, I guess I call her Karma\\nCopped a jet ski with the booster seat, I'm kiddin' but I'm ballin'\\nJust playin' but I'm serious, I'm witted and I'm wildin'\\n\\nThis life goes on, man, that's one thing about it\\nThis life goes on, dawg, that's one thing about it\\nI'm feelin' what you're sayin', you're tryin' to get around it\\nBut life goes on, pimpin', the wise don't doubt it\\n\\nStuck in the sky, first time upside down on the whole ride\\nAnd I wasn't much into the type that my bros like\\nSo I never really had no wife and that's alright\\nBlack woman ain't got no man,\" that's what she said to me\\nYeah she did, that you can date outside your race, I mean\\nI ain't supposed to show my love\\nJudge gotta like my case, I mean\\nSomebody please switch my plates, ship my car to Rome\\nk on the wheels, still ain't ridin' chrome\\nBackpack rapper skills, veteran nigga deal\\nSo let irrelevant nigga do what irrelevant nigga feel\\nLet a regular nigga judge\\nBecause his gavel fake and he regular, still\\nHow that gravel taste? How you paid your medical bill?\\nSands white on my tan feet, Colosseum in the back seat\\nStraw hut where the beach be\\nLike screen saver when your Mac sleep\\nRelaxing, I ain't racin' no fuckin' rats, I'm relaxing\\nAnd if it's wrong to ya\\n\\nWell, life goes on, brother, that's one thing about it\\nLife goes on, my nigga, one thing about it\\nI'm sayin' what you're seein', we tryin' to talk around it\\nBut life goes on, pimpin', the wise don't doubt it\n",

you say?\\nOr is it just one of them days, when things ain't goin' your way?\\nCan we talk about it without the shouting?\\n\\nI know we got issues, don't wanna lose you\\nCan't let this thing fall apart\\nKnow it damn well that I got your heart\\nThink its time to rewind and start all over again\\n\\nEverybody has their arguments\\nWe all have issues that we need to deal with, can we talk about it?\\nBut that don't mean we can't get over it\\nCause It won't be the last time, can't be the last time\\nWith two hearts, one future girl I know its hard\\nBut we can't let it go, cause they wanna see us apart\\nWhat I'm saying is, there'll be ups and down\\nBut It won't be the last time, can't be the last time\\n\\nCan't be the last time, that you get mad at me\\nFor forgetting every little anniversary\\nSomething silly like me leaving up the toilet seat\\nAnd it can't be the last time, when you say I don't do this\\nWhen you say I don't do that, but you know I ain't perfect\\nGot no way to explain it, but I know we can make it\\n\\nI know we got issues, I don't wanna lose you\\nCan't let this thing fall apart\\nKnow it damn well that I got your heart\\nThink its time to rewind and start all over again\\n\\nEverybody has there arguments\\nWe all have issues that we need to deal with, can we talk about it?\\nBut that don't mean we can't get over it\\nCause it won't be the last time, can't be the last time\\nWith two hearts, one future girl I know its hard\\nBut we can't let it go, cause they wanna see us apart\\nWhat I'm saying is, there'll be ups and down\\nBut It won't be the last time, can't be the last time\\n\\nGirl, I love the things you do\\nReminds me of the reasons why I'm with you\\nLike when you walk out the door, when your clothes hit the floor\\nYou were just about to break up, and now we 'bout to make up yeah yeah)\\nUh oh oh, oh oh oh ooh woah\\nGirl just say yeah\\nOh oh oh oh, let's make up, oh\\n\\nEverybody has their arguments\\nWe all have issues that we need to deal with, can we talk about it?\\nBut that don't mean we can't get over it\\nCause it won't be the last time, can't be the last time\\nWith two hearts, one future girl I know its hard\\nBut we can't let it go, cause they wanna see us apart\\nWhat I'm saying is, there'll be ups and down\\nBut it won't be the last time, it can't be the last time\\nEverybody has their

know how the story ends\\nHer song has me\\nLooking for traces of my melody\\nAnd I slowly hum, sing the simple phrase\\nAnd not another she can deny\\nCaught in the sound waves\\nShe can feel my every line\\nYes I'm falling, but can't seem to find the words\\nFor her, yeah\\n\\nSo ohh in love, ohh in love\\nOhh in love, ohh in love\\nI want to be, the song she loves\\nAnd I never thought I'd say this baby\\n\\nFound a way to whisper in her ear\\nEverything I wanted her to hear\\nSaid I would catch her every tear\\nHold her through the many years\\nSo long I've been looking\\nFor chances of this heart in me\\nNow I know that she's the lyric and the tune\\nThat explains the meaning of life\\nThere is no music\\nWithout her to give it to me\\nYes I'm falling, but can't seem to find the words\\nFor her, yeah\\n\\nSo in love, ohh in love\\nOhh in love, ohh in love\\nI want to be, the song she loves\\nAnd I never thought I'd say this baby\\n\\nSo in love, ohh in love\\nOhh in love, ohh in love\\nI want to be, the one she loves\\nAnd I'm hoping that she plays me\\n\\nOhh in love\n",

leader\\nI need a sabbatical do an apprenticeship under Domingo\\nStudy Carreras and Luci, I ain't finna rush out a single\\nI get it when artists go loopy and lose it and get into opiates\\nLike when you get all that you wanted and that shit is not what you hoped it was\\nYou had you a formula, one hit the wall now you Ayrton Senna\\nYou had you a lady, then she hurt your ego, now you can't forgive her\\nYea\\nI'm wearing some Dickies they cost  Euro\\nI'm not even into Versace\n",

fought, it was over before it started\\nI thought that we were\\n\\nOn the same side of the battle\\nOh, I'm on the front line of disaster\\nNow it all makes sense, I've put it together\\nI guess what we have doesn't matter\\n\\nYou have me dying every night, just because\\nYou got me fighting every night to prove my love\\nWe never giving up from fighting in the club\\nI'm dying for your love, I don't know what you want\\nYou got me fighting every night to prove my love\\n\\nAll I ever did was just try to play my part\\nTry to be the man who would not let you get taken advantage of\\nBut you let it go on, and every time I see you with him\\nI wanna crack his dome Ttell me that I'm wrong)\\nBut I thought we were\\n\\nOn the same side of the battle\\nOh, I'm on the front line of disaster\\nNow it all makes sense, I've put it together\\nGuess what we have doesn't matter\\n\\nYou have me dying every night, just because\\nYou got me fighting every night to prove my love\\nWe never giving up from fighting in the club\\nI'm dying for your love I don't know what you want\\nYou got me fighting every night to prove my love\\n\\nYou have me dying\\nFighting, every night\\nDying\\nFighting, every night\\n\\nYou have me dying every night, just because\\nYou got me fighting every night, to prove my love\\nWe never giving up from fighting in the club\\nI'm dying for your love I don't know what you want\\nYou got me fighting every night to prove my love\\nOn the same side of the battle, oh\n",

right till she creams\\n'Till she writhes with delight\\nÁndale ándale, make her pray to the pipe\\nMake her worship that false phallic idle\\nI slide deep inside\\nNot too deep, not too shallow\\nI'm mindful of size\\nShe's chockful of my swipe like a capsule\\nSealed tight with that substance you need\\nStart a family tonight\\nIn this Camry we might\\nMean this big body Merc with the leather\\nOak and the LED lights\\nThat I don't even drive\\nI'm in London tonight\\nAnd it's all overpriced\\nThe dollar been cheap than a bitch\\nTuberose and tulips\\nOn the boxes you're in\\nFrom the holes in your skin\\nHit the road and get rich\\nOr stay home and get broke\\nIt's your choice in the end\\nYeah they watchin' my fence\\nLike they next to my kin\\nLike they paid by the pope\\nGot some priests by the door\\nFrisk the demons before they step into my glow\\nOh my my\\nGet it, get it\n",

glows\\nYeah\\n\\nIf we colored our white walls pitch black\\nTurn all the lights off and lay back\\nWe can make love with our bare hands\\nWe can make light out of thin air\\nOr we can close our eyes and sleep well\\nDreams feel realer than right now\\nBut whatever you do dont let go\\nMy only nightmare is waking up alone\\nIn a world where youre not mine\\nAnd the room painted off white\\nRunning out in the daylight, tryna get back to you\\nWhen I stare into your eyes, I see my real life\\nThats why I never sleep with my back to you\\n\\nWhen I lay down, facing you\\nI can feel my eyelids glow I never sleep with my back to you)\\nAnd if the sun rises, back to you) behind you\\nI dont think Id notice though\\nI never sleep with my back to you, back to you\\nI never sleep with my back to you, back to you, back to you\\n\\nLaying under the covers that I stole\\nFrom your side of the bed cause I got cold\\nYou rolled over and whispered rorobbery\\nSo you been sleeping with a thief in your bed\\nStole your heart and your pillows\\nWhatever you do just dont go\\nBaby, the worst jail is\\nWaking up alone in a world where youre not mine\\nIn a room painted off white\\nRunning out in the daylight, tryna get back to you\\nWhen Im looking in you eyes, I see my real life\\nSo I never sleep with my back to you\\n\\nWhen I lay down, facing you\\nI can feel my eyelids glow I never sleep with my back to you)\\nAnd if the sun rises, back to you) behind you\\nI dont think Id notice though\\nI never sleep with my back to you, back to you\\nI never sleep with my back to you, back to you, back to you\\n\\nLike a nightlight\\nLike a teddy bear\\nLike a toddlers blanket\\nLook at us baby, two grownups acting like children\\nOoooooo, yeah\\nWhen I lay down, facing you\\nI can feel my eyelids glow I never sleep with my back to you)\\nAnd if the sun rises, back to you) behind you\\nI dont think Id notice though\\nI never sleep with my back to you, back to you\\nI never sleep with my back to you, back to you, back to you\\nWhen I lay down, facing you\\nI can feel my eyelids glow I never sleep with my back to you)\\nAnd if the sun rises, back to you) behind you\\nI dont think Id notice though\\nI never sleep with my back to you, back to you\\nI never sleep with my back to you, back to you, back to you\n",

float\\nWhite Ferrari\\nHad a good time\\nI let you out at Central\\nI didn't care to state the plain\\nKept my mouth closed\\nWe're so familiar\\nWhite Ferrari\\nGood times\\nI care for you still\\nAnd I will\\nForever\\nThat was my part of the deal\\nHonest\\nWe got so familiar\\nSpending each day of the year\\nWhite Ferrari\\nGood times\\nIn this life)\\nYou love me still and you will forever\\nYou got that part of the deal\\nWe got so familiar\\nRunning my hands thru your hair\\nWhite Ferrari\\nHad a good time\\nin this life)\\nOne too many years\\nSome tattooed eyelids\\nOn a facelift\\nMind over matter is magic, I do magic\\nIf you think about it it'll be over in no time\\nAnd that's life\\nI'll drop you off and in a few months\\nWe'll talk again\\nWhen you need a break\\nWhich part of the circle will you stand on\\nYou keep doing the dance wrong\\nI'm sure we're taller in other dimension\\nYou say we're small and not worth the mention\\nYou're tired of moving\\nYour body's aching\\nWe should vacay, there's places to go\\nClearly this isn't all that there is\\nCan't take what's been given\\nBut we're okay here, we're doing fine\\nPrimal and naked\\nYou dream of walls that hold us in prison\\nIt's just a skull\\nLeast that's what they call it\\nAnd we're free to roam\\nLike a mirage\\nAlways one step ahead\\nWhere we belong\\nI've got a son somewhere\\nHe'll be picking up where I left off\\nI might name that boy Ferrari\\nHe'll meet a girl named Altashonda\\nHe'll treat her soft like Alcantara\\nMy brain is soft like Alcantara\\nMy hands are rough, I'm iguana\\nYour hair is long, are you Nicaraguan?\\nI can't go soft, I'm Viagran\\nYou want it all\\nYou're always one step ahead\\nWhere you belong\n",

new, weathered by time and progress, lending it a distinctive quality. A modern city embracing technology but somewhat overtaken by nature, still trying to find a balance. There are pickups and wagons amongst the luxury cars, very democratic. Steely peers into a car with a cigarette in the ashtray. Using the metallic card, he swipes it against the cars access strip and gains entry. He steals the cig, lights it and walks a few cars down. He notices a hanging air freshener in another car and decides he likes it, breaks into that car as well taking the fragrant contraband. The stillness is mesmerizing, you can barely hear the autobahn in the distance or the steps of his companion just a few feet ahead.\\nCaged court centered in a park somewhat densely populated with live oak trees, their limbs perfectly frame rather than reach above the court. Clark is around ’” or ”, lean but strapping and towering compared to a seemingly younger Steely who just beamed a ball at Clark and nearly landed a punch before Robb and Matthew bodyblocked.  Clark would have hurt him, badly, obviously, as Steely is a few years younger and developing a physique to match his mental toughness.\\n     Robb: Whoa whoa whoa level down…’\\n     Matthew: Kiss and make up, friends. Its a contact sport.’\\n     Steely: Nah, miss me with that, he always tryna big man somebody.’\\n     Clark: Checks his face for blood. Spits.) Game point.’\\nSteely steps up to guard him, placing his hand on Clarks side to telegraph his movements. Clark crosses him, drives and lays the ball up, winning the game.\\n     Clark: Whoo! RIC FLAIR voice) Did you feel that? Did you sense the sublime finesse and technique just then? You should be grateful. You should be grateful for me. Here.’\\n     Steely: Blah, blah, blah.’ Shrugs and mimes, picks the dead basketball up off the ground and does a tricky slam dunk with excess energy.)\\nThe quiet of the morning scene continues, Steely and Shoobie continue walking as if in a dream. No birds, no other people, no sounds of cars. You see cars though, and you can hear a faint wind occasionally disrupt the silence as it passes between the rubber of the vehicles and the concrete. The skyline is a blended ecosystem of the natural world and school buildings. Tall structures of glass, steel, brick and mortar raised on stilts of a hard clear substance. Limbs of trees reaching out through some windows, you see entire floors made into greenhouses and pocket jungles sprawling off rooftops. They approach a park where we see a sculpture of a child hanging from the sky from a string that goes up forever, touching the surface of a never ending rippling pond below with the tip of his finger. There are no paths of stone or concrete, the grounds are riddled with ever so slight inclines and valleys. Theres a large Olympic sized pool built with Carrara marble, students ice skate it during the winter and skateboard in it in warmer months.\\nShoobie walks slowly ahead of Steely, carrying a slate of metal, head held high, inhaling deeply and gratefully from a harmless, flavored steam cigarette. She squints her large eyes eyes on a toke and looks back at Steely going inside of someone elses car.  The colors of her eyes change. She keeps walking. Steely catches up and throws his arm around Shoobie — he quickly takes his arm back to himself then grabs both her elbows and turns her toward him.\\n     Shoobie: Bobbing her head to music that isn't playing, she sings) 'That's the way everyday goes, every time we've no control...'\\nSteely looks up at the sky. A wide, flat translucent aircraft is coasting slowly above, leaving clouds in its wake and filtering sunlight into beautiful prismatic refractions onto him.\\nHe's looking down at Shoobie, she's wearing radiation protective gear. Her helmet is mirrored orange and red, the suit has a white body. He focuses on her and not the campus being destroyed behind her by fire.\\n     Steely: Is death a high? I heard its like DMT. The guy who told me that isnt dead. Maybe its worth dying. The high I mean. Worst part about it though. We wont remember being so tight you know? Look at us!’\\nBrushes imaginary locks from his face)\\n     Shoobie: ‘..uhh?’\\nSteely looks down at his feet and theres ice on the grass though its summer. Steely pulls his head up to say snow’ but doesnt even make the begining sounds of the word. A single ball of alloy, white encoded with ice, spins around them like a tether ball to its pole. Shoobie still mouthing the words to a song playing in her head. If you could fly then youd feel south, up norths gettin’ cold soonThe way it is were on land — still im someone to hold true’.\n",

are\\nOh, were all children\\nWere all human, were all breathing\\nWere all needing, more than what they're giving\\nCant you feel it?\\nThe space of whats missing\\n\\nYou look up and they tell you its a godless sky, a godless sky\\nSo you look down\\nCause youve convinced yourself\\nThat this is all youve got, all youve got\\n\\nBut picture four billion hearts beating with yours, with ours\\nPicture four billion faces held high for love\\nIf theres one thing about this world I know\\nIts that were in it, together\\nYoure not alone, Im not alone\\nIf theres one thing about this world I know\\nWere together, were together\\n\\nI love you\\nAnd I dont know you\\nBut I know the light in you\\nIs the same as in me\\nI trust you, like a brother\\nCause who could understand the pain\\nBetter than someone whos going through it\\n\\nYou look up and they tell you its a godless sky, a godless sky\\nBut dont you look down\\nDont you convince yourself\\nThat this is all youve got, all youve got\\n\\nJust picture four billion hearts beating with you, with ours\\nPicture four billion faces held high for love\\nIf theres one thing about this world I know\\nIts that were in it, together\\nYoure not alone, Im not alone\\nIf theres one thing about this world I know\\nWere together\\n\\nIve searched the souls of my people\\nFor something to believe in\\nOh, not words that I could say\\nBut I heard them, I heard them\\n\\nJust picture four billion hearts beating with you, with ours\\nPicture four billion faces held high for love\\nIf theres one thing about this world I know\\nIts that were in it, together\\nYoure not alone, Im not alone\\nIf theres one thing about this world I know\\nWere together\n",

no\\nAh, you are my high school wifey\\nCollege made it different\\nI stayed at home and you didn't\\nYou got a scholarship to Michigan State\\nDrove my heart twothousand miles away\\n\\nAnd now I sit at home, next to the phone\\nMissing, wishing she would call\\nAnd say hello, say hello\\nI'm in the zone\\nReadjusting to the fact she's been gone\\nAnd I'm alone, I'm alone\\n\\nCan't play the same songs in my car\\nOh no cause she ain't on the passenger, the passenger\\nAnd I can't even play Madden any more\\nOh no because I can't pass to her, pass to her\\nShe won't say hello, hello, hello\\nShe won't say hello, hello, hello\\nNah, nah, she won't\\n\\nMy best friend, wish I could have went with her\\nCan't afford to visit her\\nLet alone stay\\nBut I wanna, I really wanna\\nOh, we did everything together, now I'm missing all the silly shit\\nThe way she bit her bottom lip after we kissed\\nI'm xing off the calendar days\\nI'm praying, oh, you come back again\\n\\nAnd now I sit at home, next to the phone\\nMissing, wishing she would call\\nAnd say hello, say hello\\nI'm in the zone\\nReadjusting to the fact she's been gone\\nAnd I'm alone, I'm alone\\n\\nCan't play the same songs in my car\\nOh no cause she ain't on the passenger, the passenger\\nAnd I can't even play Madden any more\\nOh no because I can't pass to her, pass to her\\n\\nMy baby baby), what am I to do without her?\\nWhoa I've been losing patience calling her\\nAnd now I sit at home, next to the phone\\nMissing, wishing she would call\\nAnd say hello, say hello\\nI'm in the zone\\nReadjusting to the fact she's been gone\\nAnd I'm alone, I'm alone\\n\\nCan't play the same songs in my car\\nOh no cause she ain't on the passenger, the passenger\\nAnd I can't even play Madden any more\\nOh no because I can't pass to her, pass to her\\nShe won't say hello, hello, hello\\nShe won't say hello, hello, hello\\nNah, nah, she won't\n",

was something in those jeans\\nLocked up\\nIt was dying to be free\\nAnd it was bound to happen, oh\\n\\nDidn't have a pick up line to use\\nI was way too cool, way too cool\\nAnd instead I hoped you're watching me too\\nLike I watched you\\n\\nIt took one look, oh, oh, oh\\nJust that one look, oh, oh\\nWhat was I to do but look?\\nOh, I couldn't stop staring\\nOh, I couldn't run away from you\\nNo, I couldn't stop\\nNo, no, just took one look\\n\\nThat's a good look baby, baby\\nThat's a good look, darling\\nThat's a good look, good look\\nSuch a good look\\n\\nMy eyes must have been on drugs\\nYour color and your shape looked so crazy\\nI couldn't see the floor beneath you\\nBut, baby, I could see you pacing on\\nThin air, midair, no\\nLong brown hair swinging, no\\nRed bottoms in your high heels\\nLike I'm watching a BluRay\\n\\nYou in HD baby\\nI didn't know what to say\\nI was way too cool, Im way too cool\\nYeah yeah yeah yeah\\nAnd I, you know I'm hoping you're watching me too\\nOh yeah, you know it's true\\n\\nIt took one look, oh, oh, oh\\nJust that one look, oh, oh\\nWhat was I to do but look?\\nOh, I couldn't stop staring\\nOh, I couldn't run away from you\\nNo, I couldn't stop\\nNo, no, just took one look\\nI wanna stare at you some more\\nWhen I can feel you in my soul\\nI'm not looking from the outside\\nI could feel your hands in mine\\nI wanna grab on your body\\nTouching that booty\\nFeeling on your booty\\nSay that you love it\\nAnd you said it's all mine\\n\\nIt took one look, oh, oh, oh\\nJust that one look, oh, oh\\nWhat was I to do but look?\\nOh, I couldn't stop staring\\nOh, I couldn't run away from you\\nNo, I couldn't stop\\nNo, no, just took one look\\n\\nIt took one look, oh, oh, oh\\nJust that one look, oh, oh\\nWhat was I to do but look?\\nOh, I couldn't stop staring\\nOh, couldn't run away from you\\nNo, couldn't stop\\nNo, no, just took one look\\nThat's a good look baby baby)\\nThat's a good look, darling\\nThat's a good look, good look\\nSuch a good look\\nThat's a good look baby baby)\\nThat's a good look, darling\\nThat's a good look, good look\\nSuch a good look\n",

shouldn't be\\nBut I'm a boy\\nIn this adult body\\nI know I said\\nThat we would grow old together\\nBut I haven't\\nAnd that's cost you years\\n\\nThis is has been the one of my fears\\nThat's has only ever caused you tears\\n\\nSo time machine, take me ahead till I'm with her\\nGotta be with her, with her, with her\\nCan't let her live by herself\\nOh time machine, maybe we can take her with us\\nLong as I'm with her, with her, with her\\nShe ain't living by herself\\nLift off and go\\n\\nI tried\\nWith all my might, I peddled as fast as I could\\nUntil the years just started to flicker past\\nOur life, oh all of it\\nI saw memories on both sides of the road\\nI pointed them out as I went along\\nRight there, we're making out listening to Purple Rain in the basement\\nAnd just ahead I can see your heart falling but I can't save it\\n\\nThis is has been the one of my fears\\nThat's has only ever caused you tears\\n\\nSo time machine, take me ahead till I'm with her\\nGotta be with her, with her, with her\\nCan't let her live by herself\\nOh time machine, maybe we can take her with us\\nLong as I'm with her, with her, with her\\nShe ain't living by herself\\n\\nI'm on my way there\\nTo that time in space\\nI wish you could see, all that I see now\\nI'm headed towards you, yeah\\nI wish that time could wait\\nI'm on my way home\\nThis is has been the one of my fears\\nThat's has only ever caused you tears\\n\\nSo time machine, take me ahead till I'm with her\\nGotta be with her, with her, with her\\nCan't let her live by herself\\nOh time machine, maybe we can take her with us\\nLong as I'm with her, with her, with her\\nShe ain't living by herself\\nLift off and go\\nLift off and go\n",

                                                                                                                                                                                      In one class, a smooth but occasionally glitchy D projection of a teacher greets Steely. The teacher is severe in appearance and manner. Though her projection corresponds to a live human being somewhere else on the planet, she might as well be a robot or at least the ghost of a human once capable of warm emotion.\\n     Teacher: 'Punctuality appears to be your Achilles' heel, Mr. Grude. Alas, you've cleared H, admirable. Quiet your ears, then solve the riddle.'\\nThe teacher trails away.\\nSteely exhales loudly. Takes his bag off and hangs it on a hook. There is a digital hour clock in the top left corner, it's black steel with white numbers. The walls are covered in floral wallpaper, overhead there's a clear paneled mechanical ceiling. The mahogany floors ramp up to class seating, with curves and layers dynamically represented. A wall for projection wrapped in a semi circle lies at the head of the class.\\nSteely breathes in deeply, dropping his shoulders. The room is so quiet. He closes his eyes. A montage flashing in his head: Shoobie's mouth, himself as a small boy calling up from a pit, fencing, climbing a fence, running. A small quiet click comes into his ears from a clock. The memory of his father first forgetting while giving a lecture at his school. The silence. The stutter. The angry burst at someone touching his arm. He remembers his father not remembering him. His mother throwing things out of focus. The canopied street. The first car he stole on a spinning platter. His father's car.\\nSteely is mumbling a mantra and slowly his memories whitewash away. He opens his eyes and he is seated on a chair in full lotus. He breaks position and pulls a tray out of a side compartment and now he has a surface with a bowl in its center, a few gauges and a small loupe. It's what seems to be a mini solar system that he's manipulating with the gauges.\\nThe teacher swarms back in and places a decadesold transparency paper on a projector.\\nThe riddle:\\n     Teacher: 'You poured it hot and you're stirring it up, now what's moving faster, the tea or the cup?'\\n     Steely: 'The tea.'\\n     Teacher: What's harder Mr. Grude, a liquid or a solid?'\\n     Steely: 'Shit'\\n     Teacher: 'Of course. And what does your understanding of physics inform you of as it relates to softness and hardness of matter, Mr. Grude?'\\n     Steely: 'That, from a subatomic perspective, my shit is composed of particles mostly vibrating at a higher rate than my piss.'\\n     Teacher: 'Thank you, Mr. Grude. Your deft articulation leaves little to the imagination.'\\n     Steely: 'You don't have an imagination.'\\n     Teacher: 'Well, congratulations Mr. Grude. It has been my pleasure watering yours.'\\nThe teacher swarms off. A status bar appears on the projection wall as if loading something. When full, a dozen other desks appear next to Steely each with a student projection seated in them, creating trails with their movements. These projections seem almost real. Unlike the microcosm whose projections are light based, the students' apparitions are hard particle nano projections whose touch have a light weight, thus they can interact with the physical world on a low level. The teacher rematerializes.\\n     Teacher: 'Grad students, the last movie of your lives here. Giant\"—. Enjoy.'\\nSteely looks down at his desk. His microcosm is developing well, thriving. There are  life harboring planets in his system. He looks through his scope. He monitors his gauges, adjusting tension and gravity here and there.\\nSteely receives a tummy rub via instant messaging from Shoobie, and a pouty face. He replies with a blush face. The movie plays and a couple of the students are watching. The class is / male to female. A swirl of different races and creeds. Someone's nose starts bleeding. A Japanese student crinkles plastic in a Russian girl's ear to annoy her. Two students are reading palms. Steely extends his hand, taps a blue eyed Korean kid named Kio.\\n     Steely: 'Howdy'\\n     Kio: 'Listen. It's out of control. My parents are hiring a load of lifeguards for this weekend. Apparently someone drowned last year at the pool party I've never had. Been on my Kegel exercises since last week.\\nKio's projection spreads hair on Steely's scalp with his swarm fingers and examines it before Steely shakes him away)\\n     Kio: 'Your hair is so clean?'\\n     Steely: 'Kioget off.' Doesn't move. Focuses his sight through the scope down into the microcosm.)\\n     Kio: Speaking out loud) 'Western hygiene has lacked as fuckthese guys look dank.'\\n     Blonde Girl: 'Close your mouth!'\\n     Kio: 'Only if you keep yours open.'\\n     Blonde Girl: You're small.'\\n     Kio: 'She didn't talk to me like this last night. I'm so confused. This sucks.'\\n     Blonde Girl: 'Do you know I can hear you? What was last night? I'm in Morocco.'\\n     Kio: 'Last night, last monthwhenever this loud sex was. I forget.' Kio turns his head and is punched in the nose by Blonde's swarm hand.)\\n     Blonde Girl: Warns) 'You are a small feeling. Do not!'\\nThe downpour outside intensifies.\\n     Steely: 'She didn't like that one, Kio.'\\n     Kio: 'Bro, whatever, she's a lunatic, and she just got herself uninvited.'\\n     Steely: Laughs and shakes his head.)\\nDree, the Pacific islander student, taps Steely.\\n     Steely: 'That's TWO cartridges.'\\n     Dree: Says 'okay' without saying anything.)\\nIt thunders soon after a grand flash of lightning. Rain comes down heavier and heavier, then a black out.\\nThe D swarms of students and teacher disappear and the room goes dark. The glow of Steely's experiment is the only light source in the room. His gaze stays stuck on the system, its glow upon his face. Just then a message notice activates.\\nGROUP TEXT:\\n     Matthew: 'Anybody seen Robb? I think we lost Robb black ass.'\\n     Robb: A piece of me with always be inside of you.'\\n     Shoobie: 'lol' emoticon)\\nSteely gets up from his desk, pulls his hoody over hid head and goes to use the urinals outside in the storm.\\nIt's pouring as he walks toward a small shallow tower of urinalsthey resemble a merrygoround. He pisses with the rain falling on him hard. No one is outside. He washes his hands on a faucet above the urinal then heads back toward his class. Sunlight cuts through the rain. He gets back to his seat, soaked, and sits down in the naturally lit room. He looks down at his bowl for a moment, lights a cigarette and stares at it for a moment. Spinning it around and staring at the ember trails. The sunlight creates streaks across the classroom through the ceiling. He pushes everything back into a single point then folds the desktop back into the compartment.\\nSteely's eyes well up.\n",

up with rain\\nMy boyfriend he gon pick me up\\nDon't distract him at the wheel\\nIn his lane\\nHe's the only one\\nMy boyfriend he misses me when I'm gone\\nSo he don't forget me\\nThere's a song he sings\\nCalms his nerve, endings\\nMy boyfriend is friendly\\nAnd we don't want no problems\\nI could say that I'm happy\\nThey let me and my boyfriend become married\\nI could say that I'm happy\\nBut cross my heart I didn't notice\\nHope to die no never, we voted\\nMe and my boyfriend cast our ballot\\nEvery kiss reads like a poem\\nMaking wrongs right like a poem\\nI couldn't say I dream of you\\nBecause my dreams are filled with no one\\nAnd all is lost\\nMe and my boyfriend we found\\nWe don't hope for beyonds at all\\nMe and my boyfriend spend time\\nAnd that's all I'm holding on\\nThis time\\nWe got permission\\nNothing's above condition\\nBut this ain't a thang\\nIt's a mission\\nCan't join the band so sing along\\nMe and my boyfriend got it going on\\nSleep with fans and t shirts on\\nAsleep in vans your legs all strewn\\nAcross my lap\\nTan lines where your watch was strapped\\nYou took off to make time\\nCut your hair\\nYou left it so long\\nI love to stare\\nThere's nothing wrong\\nAnd if I die while I'm asleep\\nI pray to God my boyfriend\\nKeeps my secret\\nPeace\n",

can't state my feelings too soon\\nI don't know you\\nAnd I can't put no threats in the air\\n\\nUhh, uh, what\\nI gotta leave you be, every night you iggin' me\\nBoy, baby, get your life right, baby, message me\\nAnd I hit you back, fast, Mackin', like in Tennessee\\nOff in my room, doin' what I ain't supposed to be\\nWet sheets my sex be, I speak so messy\\nBabe pass me that death tree and let me smoke please\\nAt night you be in my room, don't care what city\\nYou dyin' to catch my seed, take off and reunite\\nDon't freak like you desperate, shout out your exes\\nThey dealt with your selfish type of aggression\\nI beat then I flexed it, that's my confession\\nI skeet just to exit off to your best friend\\nDon't take this hard, me pretty boy, how I exit\\nYou dread a thought, I made your heart an investment\\nWe creep 'cause you pressed it, that ass a weapon\\nNo sleep on that bed spread, you get this message\\nNow go on\n",

            "137  Godspeed Screenplay (Episode 1, Scene 2)  Frank Ocean              Boys Don’t Cry (Magazine)   {'year': 2016, 'month': 8, 'day': 20}  The hardwood hallway extends into a room where Shoobie is seated in front of a white desk with a translucent top that is eventually lit from beneath. Shes sketching schematics with graphite while D printing small pieces of the design from the sketch paper directly. Steely places the cereal on her table and sits on a fullsized bed cornered against the far left wall. Steely eats and looks around the room. Photos and schematics are placed on the wall, bed sheets spill onto the floor and Shoobies wearing PE shorts, varsity hoodie, ankle socks and a messy ponytail. Its a perfectly livedin moment that feels right in the ways youd hope for when two people comfortably cohabitate. Just then he noticed a message in his field of vision.\\nBEGIN TEXT:\\n     Matthew:  wya? wyd?’\\n     Steely:  Im here man. breakfast.’\\n     Matthew:  ole oatmeal eatin’ ass boy’\\n     Danny:  all star suck me ups last night’\\nSteely: who?’\\n     Danny:  imma bring her and her friend out to the water.’\\n     Steely:  oh, OK.’\\n     Mathew: about to shower---’\\n     Steely::Yea, I gotta do the same rn.’\\nSteely puts the phone down and finishes his bowl of oatmeal. Shoobies cereal sits untouched where he placed it, getting soggy.\\nSteely returns to the kitchen, puts the bowl in a light wash rack. He pulls on a shallow drawer and grabs a refrigerated metal slate from a stack of four. The slate responds to his touch, turning transparent while a swarm of light particles activate a D projection an inch off its surface, making a mold of his hand. Steely places his hand into the particle mold then gets up and walks into the bathroom down the hall, to the right, then left of two bathrooms. Steely sits on the toilet and begins to masturbate to a video now playing on the slate. The ground changes hue.\\nTheres a signal that class is about to begin.\\n     Shoobie: Im going to class.’\\n     Steely: Should go together.’\\n     Shoobie: Yea – what about yours?’\\n     Steely: I wasnt going to go in there till later.’\\n     Shoobie: Irrational fears again?\\n     Steely: Naw…’\\n     Shoobie: They wont let you come into class late…’ Steely cuts her off)\\n     Steely: I know.’\\n     Shoobie: Truant.’ Stares him down)\\nThey kiss. Steely leans into it a bit and reaches under her skirt. Students are watching them. She punches him playfully in the chest and he backs off. Steely leaves Shoobie standing there, while he disappears down a decline, through a grove of trees.\\nSteely arrives at the entrance to a gated community, as behind him a bullet train hydroplanes silently along a narrow band of water. He lights a flavored cigarette, drops it on the ground by accident and picks it up, he puffs it to keep it alive as he walks towards a guard post. As he approaches, a woman in her fifties hangs her head out of the doorway of the security quarters. Her name is Florence and its apparent she knows Steely.\\nFlorence works multiple locations as a security guard and as Steely has developed his hobby of breaking into cars, hes also developed a relationship with Florence. She suspects what he does but looks the other way, treating him as a favorite aunt would. She has a soft spot for him and occasionally Steely brings her cigarettes or coffee or a flower picked up along the way.\\nThere are two mesh steel hates. In front of the gates are a row of solid metal cylindrical posts that swivel up and down into the ground.\\n     Florence: Cmon child.’ Lazily)\\nSteely speeds up to a slight jog up to her half doorhalf window.\\n     Steely: Yes, maam,’\\n     Florence: Put that out.’\\n     Steely: Yes, maam,’\\n     Florence: Im proud of you. You know that, dont you?’\\n     Steely: Yes, maam,’\\n     Florence: Give me a square, son.’\\nSteely goes in his parka pocket and hands two to the woman – she puts one to her mouth and lights it.\\n     Florence:  Mmmhmm, go head on.’ Turns an eye without turning her head.)\\nThe gates clear, the posts lower.\\nSteely walks through the gates and down many stairs. Before exiting the stair well he stops to read a series of text messages from various senders.\\nBEGIN TEXT:\\n     Mia: Another thought on perfection. The only problem with her is that she is too perfect. She is bad in a way that entices, and good in a way that comforts. She is mischief but then she is the warmth of home. The dreams of the wild and dangerous but the memories of childhood and gladness. She is perfection. And when given something perfect, it is the nature of man to dedicate his mind to finding something wrong with it and then when he is able to find something wrong with it, he rejoices in his find, and sees only the flaw, becoming blind to everything else! And this is why man is never given anything that is perfect, because when given the imperfect and the ugly, man will dedicate his mind to finding what is good with the imperfect and upon finding one good thing with the extremely flawed, he will only see the one good thing, and no longer see everything else that is ugly. And so..man complains to God for having less than what he wants..but this is the only thing that man can handle. Man cannot handle what is perfect. It is the nature. It is the nature of the mortal to rejoice over the one thing that he can proudly say that he found on his own, with no help from another, whether it be a shadow in a perfect diamond, or a faint beautiful reflection in an extremely dull mirror.\\n     Steely: Sorry, I hope you feel better.’\\nNEXT TEXT:\\n     Steely: Youre not athletic.’\\n     Clark: We could line it up.’\\n     Steely: You week, haha.’\\nNEXT TEXTS, STEELY READS BUT DOESNT RESPOND:\\n     Unknown contact: Have a day you dreamed of.’\\n     Andree Pacific islander): One more pak and Ill drop it.’\\n     Kio: BITCHES LOVE YOU.’\\nNEXT TEXT:\\n     Shoobie: Who r u with rn?’\\n     Steely: No one :/’\\n     Shoobie: Matthews house? bored. misu.’\\nHe finishes his correspondence and continues on. The stairwell opens to a strip where two wide roads sit, parallel but not separate. The lefthand road leads to a Cape Cod  style country club and what looks like a beach. Near the country club, a split in the main road leads to another wide, twoway road where the opposite directions are paved at different heights, like a shelf. Theres a black sand beach on one side and mature manicured hedges on the other; the tops of homes are visible. Steely walks down the road and as he passes a second block, the road narrows and inclines to a cavernous walkway that winds through the greater community.\\nA guys with a long curly afro, wearing a white hooded jacket with M accents, shorts, waist weights, and Nike running shoes comes out of a property. He jogs in place and does some light stretches. Steely walks up to the guy who turns out to be his friend Matthew, while casually running his fingers across the hedges. The two of them wave low and perfunctorily at each other then cross paths. Though theres acknowledgement, it seems a bit clandestine as if theyre about to set something in motion.\\nMatthew jogs downhill with his arms outstretched and banks right into a still narrower canopied alley. Steely stays in place and keeps time. Matthew is now jogging perfectly center though a lane with mesh steel garage door every  years. He picks up the pace in his jog as you see the garage door open ten yards ahead – a white singleseater begins to speed out the garage but manages to stop right before hitting Matthew. Matthew acts startled.\\n     Matthew:  Yelling at the Garten, and slamming his hands on the hood) DAMN – NICE BREAKS!’\\nMatthew then jogs on following the car as it speeds in a straight line away from the scene till its no longer visible. Matthew hits a corner, makes a right and meets Steely back in front of Matthews house. They walk inside the yard gate through hedges and past fountains down a ramp into a cave like living space with an unobstructed view of the ocean.\\nThey pass cleaning staff and art leaning up against the walls. Outside the window you can see where his yard slopes down to the ocean side cliff. Theres a pool with a high dive, a solarium, a lone, odd colored dog sits gazing at them as they walk through the house and towards Matthews bedroom. Matthew changes clothes quickly as Steely is talking to him about weed.\\n     Matthew:  Fronto leaves?? – You act like you discovered fire.’\\n     Steely:  You ever catch Mr. and Mrs. Hagen intimate – in their moment. Id bet you havent, because theyre stuck with you. How free will they be when youre out on your own? Theres a place for you in this world bro and Im your friend, ok?’\\n     Matthew:  Youre acting out now, you can stop.’\\n     Steely:  Mrs. Hagen Im sure is still very agile on that horse.’\\n     Matthew:  You want some water or something?’\\n     Steely:  Yea. Do you dance still. You used to be a good dancer. Walks away to kitchen)\\n     Matthew:  Pour my shake out the blender!’\\n     Steely:  Calling out from kitchen) Nah, you dont have any ice!’\\n     Matthew:  Calling out from bedroom) Who the fuck said anything about ice?!’’\\n     Steely:  Sorry, you know I really appreciate you buddy. I couldnt find anything quite right for Shoobies birthday – everythings so generic to her, she just scans it with her computer eyes.’\\nSteely walks into the bedroom again, Matthew is ready to leave. Steely hands him a shake and eats small pieces of fruit while finishing a blue can of Coke. The two of them exit Matthews room into an area where nothing else is in the shot apart from a righthand drive Nissan Skyline from a hundred years ago and a small orange groove. Steely relights the fronto leaf blunt.\\n     Matthew:  Put the fronto out. Drive.’\\nLater on the drive.\\n     Steely:  I cant think its too many notes.’\\n     Steely:  Hes not on the  yet. Thats impossible.’\\n     Matthew:  People are fucked.’\\n     Steely:  Hes taking his time. How did he look when you ran into him?’\\n     Matthew:  People are so fucked… Uhh, yea – he looked really happy to see me.’\\n     Steely:  What are you talking..cuts himself off)? Why are people fucked? That include you or nah?’\\n     Matthew: People are just bad, like, toward other people. I should quit giving this traffic..but I cant.’\\n     Steely:  You gonna tell me something I dont know?’ Says this with the look on his face and not words.)\\n     Matthew:  I showed you this already, but watch again.’ Handing Steely his phone to watch something.\\n     Matthew:  When the lady gets sent to the neighbors house by her uncle to fight someone and she ends up running and getting chased, then falls down, breaks her shit and they set her on fire..’\\n     Steely:  Yea, that hurt my feelings. She seemed to confident.’\\n     Steely:  Did you listen to that Goye thing I told you about?’\\n     Matthew:  Yeah. Are those lights new?’ Looking at lights that follow the highway railing.)\\nTopography blurred outside the vehicle grass – suburbia and city overlapping – hyper color – non specific.\\nMatthew pulls into a sprawling office campus. We see a network of buildings, there are people from the company walking about engaged in conversation. One group in particular is huddled and highlighted.\\n     Colleague #:  Exploded?!’\\n     Colleague #:  Without heat?’\\n     Colleague #:  Yeah, or human shrapnel.’\\n     Colleague #:  So absent of heat, absence of residual bio and absent of our guy.’\\n     Colleague #:  Hes jumped on grenades before and lived.’\\n     Colleague #:  Chemiluminescence isnt the mark of a grenade.’\\n     Colleague #:  Maybe saving the world a few times makes you eligible for dharmic ascension?’\\nOffice campus is a CAR FREE IS A CAREFREE’ zone – there is offsite parking for commuters.\\nMatthews car is stopped. They trade places at the wheel and Steely gets out. He walks towards the outskirts of the office campus. Matthew tries to pull unto the parking structure which is multilevel and underground. He begins to argue with the security person manning the entrance.\\n     Matthew:  Why are you telling me I cant park here?? Its a free world.’\\n     Parking Security:  Credentials please, sir? Sir. Sir. This is a corporate facility, credentials please.’\\n     Matthew:  Whats the corporate ever done for me?! Huh? Since you know every God damn thing. What they done?? I should sit down right here and take a hot shit in the facilities.’\\nSteely walks down the ramp into the structure casually, trying not to be noticed – the distracted guard notices and chases after him shouting about credentials. Steely breaks into a sprint. Seconds later a small low flying autonomous aircraft is heard in pursuit of Steely down the structure.  Steely spots Gartens car, the one that almost hit Matthew earlier, slides over the tip of it and almost falls of the edge of the parking structure which cascades into a waterfall, leading down into channels below street level.\\nSteely regains his balance and struggles with his car boosting key card, trying to gain access to Gartens car. It isnt letting him into the car and he begins to panic, but finally it clicks on – you can hear the whistle and the buzz of the security drone flying towards him. He slides down the seat so as not to be visible from the window. The drone flies to the edge of the parking structure and hovers, observing downward as the water flows. It then turns around and heads back to continue its search elsewhere. Just then Steely feels the vibration of an incoming message.\\nBEGIN TEXT:\\n     Unknown contact:  Chase the rabbit three ways down, a ways to go.’\\nSteely:  Whos there?’\\n     Unknown contact:  Do you have time?’\\nSteelys baffled by the text but doesnt have time to dwell on it, he starts the car and begins looking for another spot to park it, far enough from the original spot so as not to be noticed but still within the same parking structure. The perfect spot is three levels down. He carefully exits the car, makes his way into a common walkway towards a lift, gets inside though its crammed with people, and squeezes in amongst the plainclothed engineers and corp. Employees all talking in code and oblivious to Steely.\\nElevator doors open. Above ground its raining. Everyone braces for the rain as they exit. Steely puts his hood on and walks into an overpass. Billboards tower above it showing blue skies, a beach scene and a slogan that reads: Its June in Miami”. The rain continues pouring down, hes still in the thick of the crowd. Steely exits down a ramp, jumps over a shallow ledge, walks under an overpass – theres traffic speeding past him blurred – and begins to wait. Matthew pulls his car over, shining his lights on Steely. Steely gets into the car and steals the cigarette Matthew just lit from his mouth. Cars speed past going under and over intersections. A song played.\n",

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          With Lonny,” Rosie recalls, he had that drive towards being successful. And certainly, they spent enough time in Sydneys studio to make a lot good music together, and they did. I was a lot more worried about Tyler. I remember chasing him around the house saying Tyler, I think youre crazy, I think theres something seriously wrong with you.’ And I remember Lonny was there and said, Auntie Rosie, let me get this clip!’ I said, You better not!’” She laughs. I had curlers all in my hair. And he wanted to get this on film!”\\nWith a big heart and warm personality, Rosies quick to take others on as her own, and give Frank the same maternal care and advice that Jonathan reaps, as heard on Not Just Money,” an interlude on channel ORANGE. She also has a particular flair for voicemails: She makes another guest appearance on the new album, with a voicemail that warns of flesheating bacteria thats roaming rampant on college campuses.\\nSat in an IHOP where the waitress knows how she takes her coffee extra hot for the first cup), Rosie comes here often to study, currently in graduate school for Psychology and Therapy. Though she can chat for days, shes an equally good listener, and an acute observer, the result of  years working as a probationparole officer in Los Angeles. Dressed superfly, with a sharp sense of style due to her daily routine she calls prep before you primp”) Rosie brings us into her world and tells it how it is.\\nInterviewer: How did Frank and Jonathan meet?\\nRosie: They met through Eddie and Raymond, they are also my nephews. And then Jonathan introduced Lonny to Sydney. Thats how they came together, musically and creatively. They would meet at Sydneys house in high school, and they would compose music. And they just loved it; they just had a wonderful time. And I stayed on Lonny: Lonny, get my son home by curfew!” I made him give me his cell phone number, and I would fuss at him. I kept him running for sure.\\nInterviewer: Your voicemails are stuff of legends. What do you love about leaving people messages?\\nRosie: I think when you call someone, you should leave a voicemail for them. But with my son, I do leave voicemails for him, Ill often leave inspirational voicemails. Sometimes I leave nasty voicemails too! And Ill leave nasty voicemails for Lonny too, when the timing is right! I want them to always remember to just be themselves, they dont have to be the type of man described in a rap song. They dont have to be balling, they dont have to be ballers, they dont have to be shot callers. I leave voicemails for my son in particular because I want my son to remain optimistic. I want him to know that his mother has his back, no matter what. I want Lonny to also know that Auntie Rosie is here for him.\\nInterviewer: Whats the last advice you gave to Frank?\\nRosie: When I last saw him, he came by the house, and he was in this beautiful… Porsche I think it was? Sedan? It was gorgeous. And I said, Remember in life, you have to have both swagger and sway. With swagger alone, youre convincing yourself that you have something that you really may not have, and that others dont see in you. sway is knowing what to do with that swagger. Sway is influence. Its persuasion, and I shortened it to sway. You have to believe in yourself, but you also have to impart that confidence in such a way that you convince other people to believe in you, and take a chance on you. In life, youve got to have both swagger and sway. Remember that.’ He laughed and said, Okay Auntie, Ill remember that.’ And I said, By the way I am going to trademark that statement! Its a Rosie original.’\\nInterviewer: Are you into cars as well?\\nRosie: I really do love cars. I drive a  Chevy HHR, and I love that little care. Thats the longest Ive ever kept a car. Normally I would keep a car for only two years, because I love different cars. Although now I have a KIA Optima, which Id bought for my son to drive when he was in college. KIA and Hyundai are sister companies, and I find they make very good vehicles. As a matter of fact, the car that Rodney King, black in , outran the police in was a Hyundai. Imaginethis funnylooking black man, in this this funny sounding car, outruns the police. You know that made them angry! So even then in , the Hyundai was a very good car. It was very fast. I love cars. I have to wash and vacuum my car every week, because somehow I see the car as an extension of me. They seem to drive better when theyre clean! There was a commercialI believe it was for Cadillacand it said when you turn your car on it should do the same for you.” I also owned a Cadillac, an Escalade, several years ago. And my motto was: When you in a Cadillac, you know where you in a Cadillac, you know where youre at.” Theyre wonderful cars.\\nInterviewer: What was your favorite ever car?\\nRosie: I would say my Chevy Camero. I was younger of course, it was red, it was fast. Of course, I appreciate the Pinto that my mother made my sister hand down to me, I think it was a ‘ Pinto. But the Camero was the car that I bought for myself; it was my first brandnew car. And it lasted: I had over , miles on that car.\\nInterviewer: What are your thoughts on social media and the younger generation?\\nRosie: I do believe that they are, in many ways, in a good place. I believe that social media is a medium by which they do communicate with one another, and also become activists in many ways. It truly is an opportunity for activism. However, I also do believe that it can also be very destructive in the sense that it can derail their focus. Forms of social media are potentially very addictive. And they can consume too much of your time to the point that you are too concerned with what other people think about you. I do believe that people that use it have to know how to use it, and hot to limit its use.\\nSometimes Id hear my son laughing in his room, so Id walk in his room and say, Whats so funny? What are you laughing about?” And he would say, Mom, Im talking to my friends.” And Id say, Youre not talking to your friends, you are typing to them.” I would go and get the house phone and bring it to him and say, Here. Call them. Hear their voices.” I also told him this: Do not ever ask a girl for a date through text.” If a guy ever asked me for a date on a text, I would probably text back something very unkind, with an exclamation point!\\nInterviewer: Do you use social media yourself?\\nRosie: I dont know how to Tweet. No, let me say thisI sent a tweet a couple of years ago, maybe a year and a half ago, to MC Hammer. Somehow I got a tweet from MC Hammer, and I tweeted back to him somehow in my reply! That was my one and only time. He had been arrested by the policeit was profiling. I said to MC Hammer, Remember this. The lesson thats to be learned is the police officers lesson to learn. It is his lesson to learn that not all black men are thugs, and that you cant judge a book by its cover.” Actually theres one thing Id like to be able to use social media for! With Micheal Brown having been killed in Ferguson Missouri, theres one tweet I would love to send out. I believe that this jury is not going to come back with an indictment of Darren Wilson. I believe that so much time is elapsing now over this entire case, I believe theres a lot of corruption going on in the investigation of this case. One Tweet I would like to hear the crowd shout out is: We know about the wait, theyre getting their lives straight!” I would love to have someone tweet it for me and say, Auntie Rosie said that you all need to shout this out!” I believe that they are delaying the investigation of this case because theyre getting the stories straight. Sowe know about the wait, theyre getting their lies straight. Although Im a peace officer myself, I believe that we have to respect people, we have to be respectful to their rights, we cannot become so intoxicated with our own power that we in fact think that we own the world and we run it, and everyone else is just a guest. We have to stay in our place too; we have to stay in our lane.\\nInterviewer: Whats some advice youd give someone reading this magazine>\\nRosie: Dont confuse stability with stagnation. In life, you want to move towards stability. The stability is what you want in your family life, its what you want in your job and career. Dont look for excitement in everything you do; we have to be able to live and contend with boredom. But that doesnt mean that youre stagnated. Remain inspired throughout life, curious, moving forward. We should not be afraid to risk, to take a risk. We should have courage.\\nInterviewer: Whats the best advice someone gave you?\\nRosie: I remember the encouraging words of my mother, who would always saythe sky is the limit. Her life was certainly not an easy life, being a black woman coming from the south. She raised five children on her own because my father also passed away, when I was a little girl. So my mother raised five children on her own, cooking and cleaning houses for other people. She did not have a formal education but she was one of the smartest people I knew. She was very bright, very intelligent, and she always imparted optimism in us to do our very best.\\nInterviewer: Whats important to you, in becoming a therapistpsychologist?\\nRosie: As a therapist, and as a clinical psychologist, we are the agents of change. I believe that we should never give up on life. We certainly are all interconnected in life, and we all need each other, regardless of our race, creed, color, regardless of our nationality. My lifeand how I interact with peopleis not a zerosum game, in the sense that my gains are not your losses, my losses are not your gains. I feel that my gains can help you win, and your gains can help me win. And so we all need help from one another.\n",

living space, a bar that looks off into the distance. Outdoorsman photography and console portraits line a wall. A photo of Steely and his dad holding a catch by the sea, another of him climbing a half dome. There's a jellyfish aquarium. The seating area is an ecosystem all its own with more plants and contained living micro systems. He eats pasta and watches television. Once he finishes eating he gets up, undresses, grabs his recall device and heads to the bathroom. Steely walks into a yellow shower. A D projection of a woman in blue washes his back.\\nDunk. Break for the curb. Clark taps Steely on the ass, blows him a kiss. Clark shoves him. Steely stumbles and walks over to a vehicle parked on the side. Steely leans on the driver window and kisses the driver. Steely circles to the other side and sits in the passenger seat. Driver puts a dutch to Steely's mouth. Steely hits it. Steely and driver kiss blowing smoke out of their noses.\\n     Driver Shoobie): 'Relaxxx...'\\n     Steely: Shakes head) 'Awe mandon't do thatI don't even know how it started.' leans in to kiss her again)\\n     Shoobie: 'Nope.'\\n     Steely: Kisses her face still) 'What you do all day anyway? When'd you even get here?'\\nShoobie ignores him, and changes a song on the playlist she was his ride there in the first place). Steely crawls out of passenger window and talks over the car.\\n     Steely: 'So what's good for later? I need to shower.'\\nMatthew and Clark walk over to the carDanny goes inside to shower.\\n     Clark: W'sup Shoobie.' Kisses her on the cheek.)\\n     Clark: 'So you gon' draw my blood and I can't hit the blunt? You cold.'\\nShoobie passes it to Clark.\\n     Steely: 'Imma be back later I left some shit in your house.'\\n     Matthew: 'What is it? I'll grab it for you now. You ain't comin' back. Y'all are about to get weird.'\\n     Steely: 'What an angelbut naw, imma come back though.'\\n     Matthew: 'Smiley faces...'\\nWide road. Canopy of live oak trees and filtered sunlight. Low radio. Engine noise layered with shower scene. Engine noise. Love scene. Engine noise. Cut to black.\\nSteely is high off endorphins while his back is being rubbed by the lady in blue. He finishes his shower, heads to his bed and crash into sleep. Steely's blurry eyes open up to Shoobie lying next to him with the look of Christmas morning on her face. It's amish. The glass now gives the views pass up on the level. Shoobie has been dealing with Garten's vehicle for the last several hours.\\n     Shoobie: 'The majority of Garten's designs contain two access points. It's a motif of his.' 'This design in particular has nearly complete function solely from one key point. The second key point is hidden. I got its location off this thing's own thoughts. Whatever, take a seat.' Pointing to the car)\\nSteely takes a seat. Black cup of coffee in his hand. Shoobie has a rainbow coil of wires running from a handheld device into a port on the headlight of Garten's car.\\n     Shoobie: 'Wait for it.' As she works)\\nIn a moment Steely's vision through the windshield glows and the city past the woods falls off into sky. His entire surroundings glow golden and white and the edges of his view fall off into endless sky. He seems to be on an island, floating high above any water. Steely jumps a bit, spills the coffee on his boxer shorts. It takes a moment for him to feel the sensation.\\n     Steely: 'Fuuuck....'\\nSteely jumps out of the car. Pulling off his burning shorts, eyes affixed to the fantastic view, which is fading back into reality all around him. His vision goes back to normal again. Shoobie smiles. Steely starts to wring out his shorts when he gets a new message notification.\\n     \\n     \\n     \\n     \\n     \\n     \\nBEGIN TEXT:\\nUNKNOWN CONTACT: '=====:::::::::=====:::::::::::\\n::::=====:::::::::====  :::::::=====:::::::::====\\n:::::::=====:::::::::====\\n:::::::=====:::::::::====\\n:::::::=====:::::::::====\\n:::::::=====:::::::::====\\n:::::::=====:::::::::====\\n:::::::=====:::::::::====' The text reads on and on and on and on.)\\nEND EPISODE \n",



                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      Christopher Chassol: laughs) So basically you're asking me..., what I think? I think everything is possible. I think it can be whatever you decide to be; whatever you choose.\\nFO: Chris, what the fuck are you talking about? you don't understand the question.\\nCC: The question is what do I think there was before the Big Bang. So  I think you can decide whatever you want because we have no clue. We are not astrophysicists; they get religious at the end.\\nOm'Mas Keith: And this is why there will always be a God principle/ When you get to the point where you can't explain everything, the human soul needs to find something because we can't accept not knowing. I'm a scientist. Everything I fuck with has been proven. That's like everything in my life.\\nCC: Really? Proven?\\nOK: Right, maths and science. It's like, this shit is real! Only in business and creating though. In love there's no rules. In love, you'll never know anything. Business can definitely know things. You can look at statistics in love and all that shit too,  but you'll always derive the fact that you'll never be able to predict anything. I think in business you can use models to predict outcomes. More so that in love.\\nFO: Wo have you guys gotten the best commentary on yourselves from? Has it been your enemies or your loved ones?\\nCC: Well it's my girl, of course. I do music to please girls, you know? At the beginning you do it for her to love me, because I want to shine in front of her.\\nOK: Like a diamond.\\nCC: I'm doing music for her to feel proud of me.\\nFO: You know that song, shine bright like a diamond?\" You don't know that song?\\nCC: No, it's from a movie? I don't know? Maybemaybe - it's a girl? Like Miley Cyrus? I don't know I'm not an entertainer.\\nOK: My mother used to always say weird shit to us, basically saying like we were a very select group of people in the hood who had some consciousness and were trying to get out. And she would always make those weird statements to reinforce that, I don't even want to repeat what she said because it doesn't sound good. Basically, telling me that I should rise above what was going on in the neighbourhood. To this day, just how ambiguous your parents or elders around you can be, my mother, my grandmother, they'd always say stuff like 'you're from here, but you're not of here.' Just a repeated mantra, always. 'Each one, teach one.' so when I talk to my mom it's all these paraphrases and lessons. When I talk to my grandmother , it's always this wisdom. Everybody older than me are the ones who really give me the commentary as I move forward.\\nCC: When we were talking, I was thinking of echoes in your life or phrases that people say when you are young... Phrases that stay. Short ones that constitute your vision. There was one guy, I was  and in a band. I was good, but I was not super good. The guy was and older guy in a bar. He said, 'Yeah, pretty good, your concert, but you don't have the sound.' I was really pissed off. I knew he was right and this phrase - I don't even know who this guy is, I met him ten seconds - but this phrase stayed to remind me that I'm not there.\\nOK: I had one guy do that. This is a pivotal moment in my beatmaking life. I was , I made these beasts and prepared them for this gentleman called Weldon Irvine who was a famous jazz musician. He came to my house, listened to my beats, and I knew they were great but he shot me down, like 'yeah they're a little busy bro.' It was my first shit of honesty that prepared me for what was going to come for the rest of my life. I always go back to that one scenario of people having that one opinion. You can let it destroy you, you have to add it to your repertoire and think about it. When he said that, I thought to myself, maybe there's a way to do things simple. I'm still on a quest for that to this day in my life, that level of simplicity, because of this interaction with Weldon.\\nFO: When I used to sing when I was younger, my mom would be like, 'stop hollering!' It used to make me all selfconscious about how I sounded, like my tone of voice or how loud I was, and I didn't want to sound like I was dying and shit. And then I discovered Prince at my mom's friend Jheri's house, I mean she used to have him on like everyday and I honestly didn't pay attention at first but I vividly remember the first time I heard 'Beautiful Ones' and this grown man singing for his life. Immediately I remember it clicking like , 'oh, it's okay to holler and scream and everything. Like, express yourself kid... Go off! So yeah, Prince basically made it all okay. Laughter) And I mean there was other stuff like my grandfather always correcting my speech, which was a regular thing. But for some reason I remember I was picking up a habit of saying, 'yes, indeed.' And like really stretching it out too which sounded country as hell. I think I was picking it up from my older twin cousins or whatever and he wasn't having it, at all. Lowkey I think he's the reason why I never picked up a strong New Orleans accent for real, which I kind if wish I did. I guess I could turn it on if I tried to but yea in general I probably just sound like I'm from anywhere in America.\\nOK: Talking like black people, what does it mean?\\nFO: Yeah, I heard that growing up sometimes. 'Oh, you talk white.' But you know what it means though.\\nOK: In the context that I grew up when I was told to talk white it was becuase I took the time to make sure everybody understood every word and used big words.\\nCC: It's about putting the white guy on the side of the intellect and putting the black guy on the side of the intuitive, primitive things. 'Oh, his language swings.' snaps fingers). 'It's close to dance. Close to the animals, to nature!' The white  guys speaks clearly like the brain. It's doing this when people say 'talking like white people' and 'talking like black people.' It's so stupid.\\nOK: That's at the core. So why are people still doing that right now? Still! In fifth grade saying to another kid, 'Why you talk black?' Why you talk white? Wigger!'\\nFO: True. But it's all changing all the time. There'll be new cultures that collide like this in the future and this will be old news.\\nOK: Do you like being alone?\\nCC: Yeah, I love it.\\nOK I hate being alone. I love to have so many people around me, much as I can. I like to have people sleeping in my house.\\nCC: I like my toilet. I need my space.\\nOK: No, everything's separate. You can't use my toilet. laughs) I like an environment where I'm in my world and there are people in the house, I don't know what it's about, but I like having people around me. I like entourage. I think I'm going to have a big entourage, really big.\\nFO: I'm not that way.\\nOK: You can be alone, huh?\\nFO: Yeah. I can be alone. But remember I used to have a bunch of people around my house all the time. All the time.\\nOK: Trusted crew, though?\\nFO: Eh, some randoms too.\\nCC: And people staying over and they wouldn't leave?\\nFO: Some people wouldn't leave, they'd just be there.\\nCC: So you're like 'so. so..' claps hands on knees)'  'what are we doing?'\\nOK: Do people do this at your flat?\\nCC: Yeah, they stay because the place is good. So I'm like 'So so so... I have to work... blah blah blah.' They won't leave! Being alone is good. With this, the invention of the iPod, it changed everything. You have all things, all of this music everywhere. The Proustrian feeling, the feeling of nostalgia, you can bring nostalgia in a place where you have never experienced it before. You had Walkmans but the iPod changed everything.\\nOK: Data revival. That's what brings those feelings. Seeing it, it gives you unlimited... It's like fucking drugs, man.\\nCC: I love good nostalgia. Nostalgia that goes for a while. It's crazy when music is so powerful. It can still be technical and poetic, like 'I know which chord makes me feel about Wednesday afternoon in .' Think like that. You could almost make an Excel document about it.\\nOK: Take for instance, every time I hear 'Don't Forget About Me' from the Breakfast Club. Whenever I immediately hear that song, I get this immediate image of being; because the only time I saw this movie was on WPIX  in syndication and it would come on Saturdays once every three months or something like that... But I always remember catching it at home on a Saturday,  years old. It takes me right back to that time, every time.\\nZing Tsejeng: Do you think people are mostalgic these days?\\nOK: I don't know.\\nCC: No, I don't think so.\n",

strength, I'm just a mirror of what I see\\n\\nBut at your best, you are love\\nYou're a positive motivating force within my life\\nIf you ever feel the need to wonder why\\nLet me know, let me know\\nLoveahhah)\\nLet me know\\n\\nWhen you feel, what you feel\\nIt's hard for me to understand\\nSo many things have taken place before this love affair began\\nBut if you feel, more like I feel\\nConfusion can give way to doubt\\nFor there are times when I fall short of what I say\\nWhat I say I'm all about, all about\\n\\nBut at your best, you are love\\nYou're a positive motivating force within my life\\nShould you ever feel the need to wonder why\\nLet me know, let me know\\nLoveahaahoh)\\n\\nTell me what it is\\nWhat it is, no need to makebelieve\\nLook beyond your world\\nTry to find, find a place for me\\n\\n'Cause when you're at your best, you are love\\nYou're a positive motivating force within my life\\nShould you ever feel the need to wonder why\\nLet me know, let me

in the streets\\nPop, pop!\\nHit out on me\\nBuilding mansions on the sand\\nYour girl looks like Kelis\\n\\nShe must hate you so much right now\\nShe must hate you so much right now\\nRun my fingers through her hair\\nMy girl looks like Kelis\\nMan she must love me so—\n",

myself, gone off tabs of that acid\\nForm me a circle, watch my Jagger\\nMight lose my jacket and hit a solo, one time\\nWe too loud in public, them police turned down the function\\nNow we outside and the timing's perfect\\nForgot to tell you\\nGotta tell you how much I vibe with you\\nAnd we don't gotta be solo\\nNow stay away from highways\\nMy eyes like them red lights\\nRight now, I prefer yellow\\nRedbone, so mellow\\nFuck 'round, be cutting you\\nThink we were better off solo\\nI got that act right in the Windy City that night\\nNo trees to blow through, but blow me and I owe you\\nTwo grams when the sun rise\\nSmoking good, rolling solo\\nSolo Solo), solo Solo)\\nSsolo Solo), ssolo Solo)\\n\\nIt's hell on Earth and the city's on fire\\nInhale, in hell, there's heaven\\nThere's a bull and a matador dueling in the sky\\nInhale, in hell, there's heaven\\nOh, oh, oh, oh\\nOh, oh, oh, oh\\nSolo\\nSolo\\nSolo\\nSolo\\n\\nI'm skipping showers and switching socks, sleeping good and long\\nBones feeling dense as fuck, wish a nigga would cross\\nAnd catch a solo, on time\\nWhite leaf on my boxers, green leaf turn to vapors for the low\\nAnd that mean cheap, 'cause ain't shit free and I know it\\nEven love ain't, 'cause this nut cost, that clinic killed my soul\\nBut you gotta hit the pussy raw, though\\nNow your baby mama ain't so vicious\\nAll she want is her picket fence\\nAnd you protest and you picket sign\\nBut them courts won't side with you\\nWon't let you fly solo, yeah\\nI wanted that act right in Colorado that night\\nI brought trees to blow through, but it's just me and no you\\nStayed up 'til my phone died\\nSmoking big, rolling solo\\n\\nIt's hell on Earth and the city's on fire\\nInhale, in hell, there's heaven\\nThere's a bull and a matador dueling in the sky\\nInhale, in hell, there's heaven\\nOh, oh, oh, oh\\nOh, oh, oh, oh\n",

that deep down\\nThe feeling still deep down is good\\n\\nIn the halls of your hotel\\nArm around my shoulder so I could tell\\nHow much I meant to you, meant it sincere back then\\nWe had time to kill back then\\nYou ain't a kid no more, we'll never be those kids again\\nIt's not the same, ivory's illegal, don't you remember?\\n\\nI broke your heart last week\\nYou'll probably feel better by the weekend\\nStill remember, had you going crazy\\nScreamin' my name, the feeling deep down is good\n"
