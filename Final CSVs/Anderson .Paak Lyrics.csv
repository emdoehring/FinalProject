Hey! Well, that's exactly what a nigga came for
Huh, you throwin' shots from afar

You might not ever come down
Naw, let me get down
You might not ever come down
Nawnawnaw, let me get down
You might not ever come down
Let me get down!

You might never ever come down
It took too long to get this high off the ground
Don't run, just stay awhile

C'mon, uh
Can't beat it, can't beat it, can't beat it
Can't beat it with a big bat, though
Can't see her with these pitch black Gucci frames on
Let me take these bitches off
Let me get the full scope, hold up
Huh, full screen, HD, let me take another picture
Let me pull it to the preshow
Whoa, cool beans, cool beans
That's a whole lot of reefer
Let me help you with the preroll

Heart Don’t Stand a Chance,Anderson .Paak,Malibu,"{'year': 2016, 'month': 1, 'day': 15}","Ooh, champagne pourin' down
Arms, legs wrapped around you
Ooh, champagne, let it fall down
Arms, legs keep grabbing

See, I be catchin' you starin', be careful
The idle mind is a dangerous place to be left in
But keep your eyes on me
Yeah, your heart don't stand a chance
It feels like it's been far too long
Your knees can't hold your legs
Your feet just want to pace
The eyes keep me all in a trance
Let me ask you
Would you leave it all in the back of your head
Or all in the palm of my hand, huh?
Ain't nobody holding you back
Don't it feel like it's been far too long, girl?
Your heart don't stand a chance
Your knees just want to break
Your eyes keep me all in a trance
And let me ask you, mmm
I know the approach is so far from what you're used to
But you know it
And do I hold a candle to the last one over your moon?
Baby, of course I do
And I'm not closing my tab
Don't it feel like it's been far too long, girl?
Huh, your heart don't stand a chance

Ooh, champagne pourin' down
Arms, legs wrapped around you
Ooh, champagne, let it fall down
Arms, legs keep grabbing

Yeah, yeah, twostep in the corridor
Spinning the greatest hits of Hall & Oates
Open of chronic smoke
I know my time will flee
But your heart don't stand a chance, uh
It feels like it's been far too long, hmm
The moment is all that we have
My meter should be up by the half
A ticket is the least of my cares
So let me ask you, uh
Am I dreaming?
Mind on the tip of a cloud
Or is it real as the stone in your crown?
Say, ain't nobody towing my Jag, uh
Don't it feel like it's been far too long, girl, huh?
Your heart don't stand a chance
I'm waiting for the white flag
You're talking with the blunt in your hand
And won't you pass that, huh?
I know in the morning
The sunlight cover your wounds, huh
But I'm hoping that I look the same as the way you always knew
Baby, of course, I flew
But I'm not over what we had, huh
Don't it feel like it's been far too long, girl, uh?
Your heart don't stand a chance
Ooh, champagne pourin' down
Arms, legs wrapped around you
Ooh, champagne, let it fall down
Arms, legs keep grabbing
I remember being tumbled around and not being able to get to the surface where the air was
And looking down and seeing my body spinning around in the white water"

And we act a fool for the paper, had a dream and I made it
El Camino on Dayton's, Vintage Guess over Bape
Put the bread on me, bitch, bitch, you bet I'ma bank it

I might just roll out to Vegas, head back to my old ways
Cop a room full of Asian hoes and do blow all day

Don't I look like a million? I'm 'bout to clean out the safe
Ddon't I look like somebody that just be bodyin' everything?
All that talkin' is great but I don't be talkin', I air it out
All the problems have gotten easy to bury
I'd rather drown them in Hendrick's, I'd rather kiss on my Mary
I been broker way longer than I been rich so until it levels out
I'ma take your mama to the Marriott and wear it out

You better be all you can, get higher than the limit, yeah
Simplify for the Dumbos, plenty slides, I can shuffle
Hit the cadence with my young bitch, Isaac Hayes, Billy Ocean
Bought the old hoe with the cane stick, left my slippers at the function
It's hard to run in Gucci slides
Chick, I thought you said you didn't have a husband
I'm a stud, no cuckold, Jackie Chan, no trouble
Can't clean it with a bib, blood drippin' from the cutthroats
No Lord, not me, I can never be the one you wanna stunt for
Money, money, that machine gun sprayed the Ferragamo store
RIP to times that I was broke, after life in  Porsche
Matte black lookin' clean, dead prezies in an envelope
Cookin up canard, waitin' for the antidote
Runnin' out of time, patience thinner than a pantyhose

My papa was behind them bars, mmm
We never had to want for nothing, mmm
Said, all we ever need is love, mmm
We see the same things
We sing the same songs
We feel the same grief
Bleed the same blood
You grew up in the home beside me
I always had a friend to call
How could I make it here without you? Mmm
I pray I leave before you're gone

Dance around the globe to Disco

Music ain't music without soul

Chill the Merlot, steady your fast pour
You pick up, we go low
Make love once or more, we rest then encore

Break you off in your KitKatKat, hey
Never seen no one this gorgeous
Pay your whole damn mortgage
Will you look at the time, hey?
Still, you the one on the mind, hey
Still, you the topic of rhyme, hey
Thank God that it's Friday
Tonight, let's be the life of the party
It's nothing to me

How did you find me here? It must be perfect timing
Forever grateful)
If I didnt love you then, I damn sure love you now
Fruit of your labor)

Say, aint shit change but the bank statements
Spent the summer in the wave with the beach babies
Threw your chula in the buggie
With the top down up the PCH
Im heading north, I hope it doesn't rain
Went from playing community ball to balling with the majors
Oh, what, you major?)
Yeah, nigga, I ran bases, pitch flame
I call plays, remove labels
And fuck fame, that killed all my favorite entertainers
Nothing short of amazing, ooh, yeah)
But Im short on my patience
Say, I dont play that shit, I dont ever forget
And dont forget that dot, nigga, you paid for it
I spent years being called out my name
Living under my greatness
But what dont kill me is motivation

To the early morn' (Momma, can you carry me?"")

And get on down before the judge give the sentence
A few more rounds before the feds come and get you
Is you gon' smile when your date gets issued?
You know them feds taking pictures
Your moms in prison, your father need a new kidney
Your familys splitting, rivalries between siblings
If cash aint king, it's damn sure the incentive
And good riddance

Is the element of danger an important factor for the members of your peer group?""
Yes, you might say that. Why dont you give it a try and find out for yourself?""

'Bout the year Drizzy and Cole dropped
Before KDot had it locked
I was sleeping on the floor, newborn baby boy

Cursing the heavens, falling out of orbit
Tryna roll this seven, tryna up my portion
What about your goals? What about your leverage?
So they dont force you into some hole
Whats the meaning of my fortune reading?
When I crack the cookie, all it said was keep dreaming”
When I look at my tree, I see leaves missing
Generations of harsh living and addiction
I came to visit during the sevenyear stint
But they wouldnt let me in because my license suspended
Now Im scraping the pennies just to kiss you on your cheek
Its gonna be a couple weeks before I get it
I know you miss me

I used to search her name hopin' we could reconnect
But if I sent the message, would she still be on my dick?
When I couldn't find her, had me feelin' mad lame
Maybe she got married and she changed her last name

Chilled my body

I bring you greetings from the first church of Boom Baptists
United Fellowship of Free Nationals
Residing pastor is Paak

Sunglasses, Martin Luther King fan for you bitch niggas

We'll do one better
Word to the liquor that killed my grandpa liver
I know you finally look proud, a nigga smiling
To every hundred niggas that came and gone missing
Only a handful will go the distance
I swear I seen this shit coming as if I was living up under the plumbing
While niggas was riffing and mumbling 'bout what they could do
I was cooking gumbo whipping the voodoo
I was in the jungle running with Zulu's
We was looking past the struggle while life was moving so fast
You had to be sharp as a Ginsu
To the top of the food group
Doing what I want and how I should, too

Chilled my body

With all the kissin', the touchin', the bitin', the tuggin'
You know, you know I love what you do
You know I know I love what you do)
And all the spittin', the cursin', the fightin' and fussin'

If I could, I'd take you everywhere
But you know I can't do nothin' with you
You know I can't do nothin' with you)
You know I never looked as good as I do, and it's the truth

Celebrate,Anderson .Paak,Malibu,"{'year': 2016, 'month': 1, 'day': 15}","Time never cares, if you're there or not there
All you ever needed was a simple plan
But you're doing well, I mean, you're not dead
So let's celebrate while we still can

I know what they say, I could give or care
They talk so much on me, I must be doing something right
I saw my son today, in the likeness of a full grown man
So I'll celebrate while I still can

Ooh, on a clear day, you can see West LA, even downtown
I remember where I couldn't even see the point
Of stepping out the motherfucking house
Let it go, let it go, let it go, let it go, let it go
I came to fixing up the tree that farms move
I've came too far

How many others have walked the same ground you have?
You'll be wise to pay attention to your old head
I spent the whole day throwin' records in the deep end
So let's celebrate while we still can

Captivated, the fruits of my family tree
Where would I be without you?
What would you do without me?
It'd be a bad look talkin' 'bout what could've been
So let's celebrate while we still can

Ooh, on a clear day, you can see West LA, even downtown
I remember where I couldn't see the point
But now I'm at the point where I got it figured out
Let it go, let it go, let it go, let it go, let it go
I came to fixin' up the tree that farms move
I've came too far


Do not be concerned about the money in your brother's hand
What's mine is yours
Thought you knew me better than that
I was under the impression that we all want the best of life
So let's celebrate while we still can

The partnership of the, of the board and the body of the fellow that is doing the maneuvers
In the fluent directions with the, with this wave is what interests me
Now chaotic surfing, nervous surfing, and uh, uh, surfing power has its, has its merits
And I, uh, I canit fascinates me. That's just not my direction
I, I can only speak for myself"

Shit, anywhere long as the runway is clear
Shit, music business movin' too fast for me God damn)
Wishin' I still had Mac wit' me Yes Lawd!)
How do you tell a nigga slow it down when you livin' just as fast as 'em?
I couldn't understand when I seen 'em stretched out cold on the pavement
Niggas catch TKO's on occasion
Wishin' I could save 'em, what was I to say?
I was doin' dates, dippin' in and out of state
We was goin' in to get away
Sick of feelin' so outta place
Wishin' I could save ya, what was I to say?
Wishin' I could save ya, but now it's too late
Now, is this really what I wanted?
Is it really worth the pain?
Now am I really an asshole? Fuck what you say
Don't do me no favors, let's get back to basics
We live for today, bitch, fuck up out my way, bitch
I'm losin' all my aces, I'm runnin' outta patience
Got some pretty faces knowin' what my name is
Up in high places, I got some new neighbors
They don't really say shit but when they see the spaceship
They just think I rap or some form of entertainment
But they don't know I'm black, young, gifted and amazin'

You know I had to close my eyes, yeah
And if I have to free my mind
I may not have the lane, movin' all along
Knowin' that I can't do it on my own
And if I got the pain feelin' comin' out
Have to run away, think I'm goin' home

Yeah, you know I'm workin' on a world premiere
And I could see the world from here
I know you somewhere in the atmosphere
I know someday I'll meet you halfway there Cheers)
They say there's nothin' you can do about it
Can't say that I'm new to sorrow
Wishin' I could take your problems
Trade 'em for a little more time wit'chu
Carry you out the bottom, the weight of the world, I got it
Sprouted wit'chu on my shoulder, the greatest honor to know ya
I'd gotta be honest wit'cha, I hate you ain't in the picture
I hate all them fake niggas claimin' like they gon' really miss ya
I know there's no one to blame and maybe the point that I'm missin'
But I needed a minute, just give me a minute

You know I had to close my eyes, yeah
And if I have to free my mind
I may not have the lane, movin' all along
Knowin' that I can't do it on my own
And if I got the pain feelin' comin' out
Have to run away, think I'm goin' home
Oh, say it ain't so!
Tears keep fallin' down my eyes
Damn it, I miss you, I should be with you
Can't turn back the hands of time but I should be with you
I miss my friend
Damn it, I miss you
Cannot bring you back

These pictures I'm seein' are fuckin' me up
And I don't know what to do but reminisce and face the pain
Back in the day before you were a dog and you were just pup
Bangin' beats and bringin' bitches back to the tour bus
Excuse me, y'all, I know this Paak shit, I just need a second
It's QTip in this bitch and I'm just in here reflectin'
Head on collisions with memories in the intersection
Lookin' in my rearview, wishin' I could be near you
The freeways of my mind are crowded with traffic
The good times that we had and them bad habits
Look at me now, look around, last man standin'
Grown man cryin' like a child tryna understand it
So sick of sendin' flowers to all of my brother's mommas
Don't know what's harder, fightin' trauma or keepin' a promise
A true confession breath is a blessin', without a question
But niggas don't get the message until they get disconnected
My story ain't over, I'm still turnin' pages
But the picture I painted with you in it has faded
My queen, my dreams and even my wages
I know what it means to lose everything when you made it
Rags to the riches and back to the rags is a muh'fucka
The consequence of puttin' all your chips in one bucket
To be honest, I feel like gettin' right back to these commas
You motherfuckers keep the drama
I'm workin' on a world premiere
And I could see the world from here
I know there must be somethin' after here
I know some day I'll meet ya halfway there in the atmosphere
Cheers

Free my mind
You know I had to close my eyes
Close my eyes
You know I have to free my mind
Oooooh
You know I had to close my eyes
You know it's time for me...
You know I have to free my mind

Free my...

This is way before the hurricane but we could see it comin'
How much for a brick if I flip? Lately I been wonderin'

Behind a cigarette
And the message coming from my eyes
Says leave it alone
Don't want to hear about it
Every single one's got a story to tell
Everyone knows about it
From the Queen of England to the hounds of hell
And if I catch it coming back my way
I'm gonna serve it to you
And that ain't what you want to hear
But that's what I'll do
And the feeling coming from my bones
Says find a home
I'm going to Wichita
Far from this opera forevermore
I'm gonna work the straw
Make the sweat drip out of every pore
And I'm bleeding, and I'm bleeding, and I'm bleeding

Maybe it was Belgium
Talking up a whirlwind
Pretty young thing
Nobody's for certain
Riding her wave
God, she was surfin'
Two hearts hurtin'
Broke beat perfect
 to like pain
Sweatin' like rain on my chain)
Left a little stain
Was she runnin' game?
I know I was runnin' game but

I wanna live
I wanna give
I've been a miner for a heart of gold
It's these expressions
I never give
That keep me searching for a heart of gold
Gold all in my watch, gold all in my chain)
Keep me searching for a heart of gold
Gold all in my watch, gold all in my chain)

Searching for something
So we entered through the matter to find what we needed
It's so much harder than I fathomed, my logic divided
If all I wanted was a hit, then I'd probably be famous
To be respected by my peers was the reason I did it
Go five years in the struggle, ain't much to a nigga
When one week of livin' lavish can fuck up your liver
Who needs provision when you covered in diamonds and pendents?
Who needs the temporaries when bitches are dyin' to get it?
I copped the ring, I caught feelin', abandoned the bride
Sold that shit for half the price just to keep on the lights
Look in the eyes and be surprised if there's anything worth mentioning
Brokenhearted in misery, pity
But while I dwell, I owe a lot of niggas
Before I finished this sentence, I promised to make bail

I've been to Hollywood
I've been to Redwood
I crossed the ocean for a heart of gold
I've been in my mind
It's such a fine line
That keeps me searching for a heart of gold
Gold all in my watch, gold all in my chain)
Keeps me searching for a heart of gold
Gold all in my watch, gold all in my chain)
Here it goes, another diatribe from Leopold
Screaming at minors not to make the same mistakes when we're old
I was a miner for pyrite
Now I'm in PriceRite buying pie tins and thin mints
Shin splints for a retired digger downsized signal thin hints that I'm a retired nigga
I'm just looking for a woman who will let me sing in the shower now
For a woman who doesn't have Dwight Eisenhower brows
I feel dumb listening to Neil Young, I recline
The spiel was sung and still I decline
The laughing track was always lethal
And I can never remember what size you like your frappuccinos
You say those heart pains were a fluke
Praying to Saint Luke in the morning
Never glanced up from reading Marmaduke, I'm in mourning"

That God himself did make
Us into corresponding shapes
Like puzzle pieces from the clay
And true, it may seem like a stretch
But its thoughts like this that catch
My troubled head when you're away
When I am missing you to death
When you are out there on the road
For several weeks of shows
And when you scan the radio
I hope this song will guide you home
They will see us waving from such great heights
Come down now,"" they'll say
But everything looks perfect from far away
Come down now,"" but we'll stay...
I tried my best to leave
This all on your machine
But the persistent beat it sounded thin
Upon listening
And that frankly will not fly
You will hear the shrillest highs
And lowest lows with the windows down
When this is guiding you home

OBE
Verse  Anderson Paak)
Sitting in my bedroom counting
Money by the thousands
Not enough to say but its just enough to get me up the grey
So I'm heading on a one way train to the Bey, up the mountain
The true definition of a come up
Better yet the definition of the perfect summer
Hotter than July as I ride through the tunnel
Thinking how can I survive in this WiFi jungle
Was the time that I heard God mumble
Open up your eyes enterprise space shuttle
Put that bitch in drive let it ride through the ruckus
Get high motherfucker, these haters can't touch you
Higher than the OBEY flyer
Still whipping something from my knuckles like a slider
Shadow is to the hand and the hand is to the body as to the soul and the true definition of rock n roll

And that's better than the best of

Following googly maps?
Could it be? Don't know

Locked up in my pockets

Goddamnit, I did damage on my last shit
Pop champ with some of the greatest in the gambit
Pop tags off of debit, in sweatpants and
My bucket cap got me looking like Jam Master Jay
Big bands, I was throwing up that magic
But how I went from getting dances to giving counseling
Bitch told me I'm pretty as Zoolander
Play the drums better than that Nick Cannon flick
And I say
There has never been another in hiphop til I came
That can spit and play the drum kit
At the same, entertain
If there was let me know
Bitch, I'll wait
Is that your chick? Is she a thot? Is that your man? Is he a cop?
What's your plan when that capping for the gram get you knocked?
I could never wish prison, even on my biggest op
I just hope you niggas saving, a good lawyer costs a lot
I was just sixteen in a F-
Juice off a new state prop in the rock
Look it up, look
Where was you the day that Snoop Dogg beat the murder case
Hallelujah baby
I'm saying any given moment we could lose it, baby
I'm just living like the days before the crucifixion
And to be honest, after watching R Kelly shit
I'm tryna teach my nieces to be celibate and really patient
And uh, that's enough, bro
Ion want blow
I ain't feeling y'all niggas I'm uncomfortable
Whats killing my nigga
Thats 
Ion wanna pull up on no more funerals
'Cause Im miserable and ain't it some shit
When your pockets dumb rich, but it's still a slum village
And you look around and everything's changing
Well, at least Im with the niggas that I came with
And they wonder why I speak this way
And they love me 'cause I got the best teeth in the game
And I'm hungry since the day I first leaked in the egg
Screaming 'skeet, skeet', I could've been a stain on my mommas jeans
I ain't a gang member, but I know Game, nigga
My uncle always told me, Punch 'em in the face quick
And don't say shit, 'cause that's for lame niggas
But don't forget, you invented your own lane, nigga""
I remember nights getting pulled over pigs
Bright lights beaming off a hatchback
See I got expired tags, license don't exist
Tryna keep it cool
It's the second day of June, and it's hot enough to fry a catfish
Living off 
With the roaches and the lower income, bread mouldy in the fridge
 said he's bout to have a baby
And two months later I say the same shit
Lord knows I love her
But he also knows I wasn't really ready but who ever really is?
Smartest thing I ever did
Take you to the , fill out all them documents
If it wasn't for my sons
I'd prolly be on a long OxyContin binge
But then again
My dreams been realized, the wings was double fried
My green was stuck between the peas and kettle fries
I gave up the beef then I gave up the pork then I
Garnered a cosign from one of the goats
Come on in, you letting out all the cold air, bro
Where you been? I know you ain't forget about ya folk
Late again, I may not come when you want
But I'm always up on time, so roll up and smoke la la
Weed too potent, shit, I had to call momma
Tell her how much I love her, cooking them home products
When the bills would pile up, cereal with the water
If Lord couldn't help us we had Hamburger Helper
