Paul,Big Theif,Masterpiece,"{'year': 2016, 'month': 5, 'day': 12}","Oh, the last time I saw Paul
I was horrible and almost let him in
But I stopped and caught the wall
And my mouth got dry so all I did was take him for a spin
Yeah, we hopped inside my car
And I drove in circles 'round the freight train yard
And he turned the headlights off
Then he pulled the bottle out
And then he showed me what was love

I'll be your morning bright goodnight shadow machine
I'll be your record player, baby, if you know what I mean
I'll be your real tough cookie with the whiskey breath
I'll be a killer and a thriller and the cause of our death

In the blossom of the months
I was sure that I'd get driven off with thought
So I swallowed all of it
As I realized there was no one who could kiss away my shit

I'll be your morning bright goodnight shadow machine
I'll be your record player baby if you know what I mean
I'll be your real tough cookie with the whiskey breath
I'll be a killer and a thriller and the cause of our death

Paul, I know you said that you'd take me any way I came or went
But I'll push you from my brain
See, you're gentle, baby
I couldn't stay, I'd only bring you pain

I was your starryeyed lover and the one that you saw
I was your hurricane rider and the woman you'd call
We were just two moonshiners on the cusp of a breath
And I've been burning for you baby since the minute I left"
Vampire Empire,Big Theif,Vampire Empire / Born For Loving You,"{'year': 2023, 'month': 7, 'day': 19}","Watching TV tired, bleeding on the bed
The milk has just expired, all the leaves are dead
I'm not quiet, you've been quiet, just receiving what you said
Reeling, feeding, feeling filled by everything you fed
I see you as you see yourself through all the books you read
Overwhelmed with guilt and realizing the disease

You give me chills, I've had it with the drills
I am nothing, you are nothing, we are nothing with the pills
I am empty 'til she fills, alive until she kills
In her vampire empire, I am

Falling, yeah
Falling, yeah

I see you there rejecting all your earthly power
Protecting and dissecting 'til you've emptied every hour
We jump into the pond, then we come under the shower
You lay upon my pillow and you open like a flower
I wanted to see you naked, I wanted to hear you scream
Wanted to kiss your skin and your everything
I wanted to be your woman, I wanted to be your man
I wanted to be the one that you could understand

You give me chills, I've had it with the drills
I am nothing, you are nothing, we are nothing with the pills
I am empty 'til she fills, alive until she kills
In her vampire empire, I am

Falling, yeah
Falling, yeah

Ohoh
Ohoh
Ohoh
Oh

Well, I walked into your dagger for the last time
It's like trying to start a fire with matches in the snow
Where you can't seem to hold me, can't seem to let me go
So I can't find surrender, and I can't keep control
You turn me inside out and then you want the outside in
You spin me all around, then you ask me not to spin
You say you want to be alone, and you want children
You wanna be with me, you wanna be with him
You give me chills, I've had it with the drills
I am nothing, you are nothing, we are nothing with the pills
I am empty 'til she fills, alive until she kills
In her vampire empire, I am

Falling, yeah
Falling, yeah
Falling, yeah
Falling, yeah
Falling, yeah
Falling, yeah"
Masterpiece,Big Theif,Masterpiece,"{'year': 2016, 'month': 2, 'day': 4}","Years, days, makes no difference to me, babe
You look exactly the same to me
Aint no time, crossing your legs inside the diner
Raising your coffee to your lips, the steam

You saw the masterpiece, she looks a lot like you
Wrapping her left arm around your right
Ready to walk you through the night

You whisper to a restless ear, Can you get me out of here?
This place smells like piss and beer, can you get me out?”
You were asking me how to get you free
I only know the recipe to roam

You saw the masterpiece, she looks a lot like you
Wrapping her left arm around your right
Ready to walk you through the night

Old stars filling up my throat
You gave 'em to me when I was born, now theyre coming out
Laying there on the hospital bed, eyes were narrow, blue and red
You took a draw of breath and said to me

You saw the masterpiece, she looks a lot like me
Wrapping my left arm around your right
Ready to walk you through the night

Old friends, old mothers, dogs and brothers
Theres only so much letting go you can ask someone to do
So I keep you by my side, I will not give you to the tide
I'll even walk you in my stride, Marie

'Cause I saw the masterpiece, she looks a lot like you
Wrapping your left arm around my right
Ready to walk me through the night"
Mary,Big Theif,Capacity,"{'year': 2017, 'month': 5, 'day': 31}","Burn up with the water
The floods are on the plains
The planets in rows
Who knows what they contain?
And my brain is like an orchestra
Playing on, insane
Will you love me like you loved me in the January rain?

Mom and Dad and violins
Somber country silence
The needle stopped the kicking
The clothes pins on the floor
And my heart is playing hide and seek
Wait and count to four
Will you love me like you loved me and I'll never ask for more

What did you tell me Mary
When you were there so sweet and very
Full of field and stars
You carried all of time
Oh and, heavens, when you looked at me
Your eyes were like machinery
Your hands were making artifacts in the corner of my mind

Monastery monochrome
Boom balloon machine and oh
Diamond rings and gutter bones
Marching up the mountain
With our aching planning, high and smiling
Cheap drink, dark and violent
Full of butterflies, the violent tenderness
The sweet asylum
The clay you find is fortified
We felt unfocused fade the line
The sugar rush, the constant hush
The pushing of the water gush
The marching band when April ran
May June bugs fly and
Push your gin Jacob
With the tired wiry brandy look
Here we go round, Mary
In your famous story book

We overcome the sirens
We look both left and right
And I can feel the numbness accompany my plight
And I know that someday soon I'll see you
But now you're out of sight
And you'll kiss me like you used to in the January night
What did you tell me Mary
When you were there so sweet and very
Full of field and stars
You carried all of time
Oh and, heavens, when you looked at me
Your eyes were like machinery
Your hands were making artifacts in the corner of my mind

Simulation Swarm,Big Theif,Dragon New Warm Mountain I Believe in You,"{'year': 2022, 'month': 1, 'day': 19}","I tried to tell you
I didn't know how to stay
You believe she can see through
Cutting at the silent clay
A relief, beckon deep blue
Fettered in the magnet sun
Eat the gun as it feeds you
Spitting up the oxygen
Once again
Once again

Once again, empty horses
Gallop through the violet door
Follow red, crooked courses
Shadows on the moonlit floor
Oh, my stars, winged creatures
Gathering in silken height
Like the last human teachers

Once again, wе must bleed new
Even as the hours shakе
Crystal blood like a dream true
A ripple in the wound and wake
You believe, I believe too
That you are the river of light
Who I love, that I cling to
In the belly of the empty night

From the thirtyfirst floor of the simulation swarm
With the drone of fluorescence
Flicker, fever, fill the form
With a warm gush, now I wanna touch
Like we never could before
I'd fly to you tomorrow, I'm not fighting in this war
I wanna drop my arms and take your arms
And walk you to the shore

I remember building an energy shield
In your room, like a temple
Swallows in the windless field
Very thin, with your mother
Tall as a pale green tree
Very wild, bright as winter
Rising with a prism key
And a child to deliver
Taken with the blood and vine
As the first little angel

Little Andy, soft in your newborn skin
Only one, little Andy, will you return again?
I believe we can renew
And you could be my brother
Once again, fall asleep with our backs against each other
You believe, I believe too
That you are the river of light who I love
That I sing to in the belly of the empty night
From the thirtyfirst floor of the simulation swarm
With the drone of fluorescence
Flicker, fever, fill the form
With a warm gush, now I wanna touch
Like we never could before
I'd fly to you tomorrow, I'm not fighting in this war
I wanna drop my arms and take your arms
And walk you to the shore
I'd fly to you tomorrow, I'm not fighting in this war
I wanna drop my arms and take your arms"

Shark Smile,Big Theif,Capacity,"{'year': 2017, 'month': 5, 'day': 5}","She was a shark smile in a yellow van
She came around and I stole her glance
In my youth, a vampire
Evelyn shone quiet as roses sting
It came over me at a bad time
But who wouldn't ride on a moonlit line?
I had her in my eye,  down the road of a dead end gleam

And she said woo
Baby, take me
And I said woo
Baby, take me too

It came over her at a bad time
Riding through Winona down the dotted line
Held us gunning out
 miles down the road of a dead end dream
She looked over with her part smile
Caught up in the twinkle, it could take awhile
And the money pile on the dashboard fluttering

As she said woo
Baby, take me
And I said woo
Baby, take me too

Evelyn's kiss was oxygen
I leaned over to take it in
As we went howling through the edge of south Des Moines
It came over me at a bad time
She burned over the double line
And she impaled as I reached my hand for the guard rail
Ooh the guard rail
Ooh the guard rail

She said woo
Baby, take me
And I said woo
Baby, take me too
She said woo
Baby, take me
And I said woo
Baby, take me too"
Mythological Beauty,Big Theif,Capacity,"{'year': 2017, 'month': 4, 'day': 5}","You have a mythological beauty
You have the eye of someone I have seen
Outside of ordinary situations
Even outside of dreams
You lie in bed at night and watch the lines
Of headlights through your screen
There is a child inside you
Whos trying to raise a child in me

If you wanna leave
You just have to say
Youre all caught up inside
But you know the way

You cut the flesh of your left thumb
Using your boyfriends knife
Seventeen, you took his cum
And you gave birth to your first life
You gave Andrew a family who you thought
Could love and take better care
I have an older brother I dont know
He could be anywhere

If you wanna leave
You just have to say
Youre all caught up inside
But you know the way
Youre all caught up inside
But you know the way

Rented a house in Nisswa, Minnesota
Shrapnel and oil cans, rhubarb in the yard
I built a ladder out of metal pieces
Father was working hard
Standing beneath the oak tree by the front door
You were inside baking bread
Sister came out and put her arms around me
Blood gushing from my head
You held me in the backseat with a dishrag
Soaking up blood with your eye
I was just five and you were twentyseven
Praying, Dont let my baby die.”

If you wanna leave
You just have to say
Youre all caught up inside
But you know the way
Youre all caught up inside
But you know the way
So much more to live your life
To walk the floor
To say goodnight
Do you leave your light on?
Do you leave your light on?
Youre all caught up inside
But you know the way
Youre all caught up inside
But you know the way
Youre all caught up inside
But you know the way
Youre all caught up inside

Velvet Ring,Big Theif,Masterpiece,"{'year': 2016, 'month': 5, 'day': 27}","Two, three, four

Shoved in the kitchen of a city tomb
The light would flicker like a violent womb
The night was thicker than a smoky fume
And Liza waited in the room
Benny loved her like he loved no one
The way she'd laugh and hold a smoking gun
The way she always said, What's done is done.""
And he was not the only one

Love is a gentle thing
Yours is thicker than a velvet ring
Yours is thicker than a velvet ring

A victim healer with a sharp sharp blade
Benny knew how she was getting paid
Her water broke and they would have to wade
And when he knew that she was fooling
He faced the mirror to avoid the thing
We're outta money and we sold the bling
And I just wanna take you home, I just wanna take you home

Love is a gentle thing
Yours is thicker than a velvet ring
Yours is thicker than a velvet ring
And I am wondering, ring
I am wondering

Real Love,Big Theif,Masterpiece,"{'year': 2016, 'month': 3, 'day': 3}","Having a bad week?
Let me touch your cheek
I will always love you

Having your face hit
Having your lip split
By the one who loves you

Real love, real love
Real love makes your lungs black
Real love is a heart attack

Showing your mother to any other
Letting them touch her
Looking up to her
Watching her do her makeup and hair

Real love, real love
Real love makes your lungs black
Real love is a heart attack

Cry like a bird, fly like a baby
Mama got drunk and Daddy went crazy
If your speech slurs, if you feel shaky, meet me out back
I'll be there waiting

Riding in the back seat
Watching the spit fly and the hummingbird cry
Oh mama, oh papa
Oh mama, oh papa
How much blood is worth the draw?
How much blood is worth the draw?

Real love, real love
Real love makes your lungs black

Hummingbird watching
Watching her young thing
Grow up so fast
Looking up to her
Watching her do her makeup and hair

Change like the wind
Like the water, like skin
Change like the sky
Like the leaves, like a butterfly

Would you live forever, never die
While everything around passes?
Would you smile forever, never cry
While everything you know passes?

Death's like a door
To a place we've never been before
Death, like space
The deep sea, a suitcase

Would you stare forever at the sun
And never watch the moon rising?
Would you walk forever in the light
To never learn the secret of the quiet night?

Still like a stone
Like a hill, like home
Still, what I find
Is you are always on my mind

Could I feel happy for you
When I hear you talk with her like we used to?
Could I set everything free
When I watch you holding her the way you once held me?

Change like the sky

Death, like a door

While everything around passes?
Would you smile forever, never cry?"

With your silk in my hand
And your heart in my sweat as you're
Lighting the end of my last cigarette
I will warm you, warm you

These things that lonely ones do
Baby, that's what I'm here for
I'll take care and make all your wishes come true
If you want to, do you want to?

Don't take me for a fool
There's a woman inside of me
There's one inside of you, too

There is a meeting in my thighs
Where in thunder and lightning
Men are baptized in their anger and fighting
Their deceit and lies
I've got lips like sugar, lips like sugar

Holding my wrist to the bed
He was thrusting and moaning
And pressing his head to my temple
His head was a temple
I said you've got lips like sugar, daddy
Lips like sugar

Don't take me for a fool
There's a woman inside of me

Saying, I love you""
Need to lie here, need to leave
Living in the debt of makebelieve
Saying I owe you
Crooked as a crow gnawing on dawn
Shadow from the grass in the dirt on the lawn
Why do I string you along?

My certainty is wild, weaving
For you, I am a child, believing
You lay beside me sleeping on a plane
In the future

Sit on the phone, watch TV
Romance, action, mystery
Wanted to show you
Sine wave is a particle ride
Bring your light out, then in on the tide
Maybe I love you
Maybe I love you is a river so high
Maybe I love you is a river so low
I love you, still don't know

My certainty is wild, weaving
For you, I am a child, believing
You lay beside me sleeping on a plane

The seasons will bend
There will soon be proof
That there is no alien
Just a system of truth and lies
The reason, the language
And the law of attraction

Mirror on mirror
And I imagine you
Taking me outta here

It isn't even a fraction

Switch to another lens
The last sunlight
I don't need any other friends
The best kiss I ever had is the flickering
Of the water so clear and bright
To leap in, my skin

Oh, Lorraine with your soft, burning hands

And the far off salty ocean
We shook our bodies and we started to scream
And I asked you again
Tell me when we grow up, do we ever go home?
You said home becomes the highway
We ordered movies on a motel screen
Until you needed me warm inside of your mouth
And my skin was salty ocean
And then you recommended I'm a woman to keep
And I called you a man"
Forgotten Eyes,Big Theif,Two Hands,"{'year': 2019, 'month': 10, 'day': 2}","Forgotten eyes are the ones which we lose
Forgotten hands are the ones which we choose
To let go of, but it is no less a bruise
On the collective arm keeping us high and gone
Forgotten dance is the one left at birth
Forgotten plants in the fossils of earth
And they've long passed but they are no less the dirt
Of the common soil keeping us dry and warm

The wound has no direction
Everybody needs a home and deserves protection‚ hmmmm

Holloweyed on Eddie Street‚ no sirens to hear
Just trash and soiled needles clawing the veneer
And no crying but it is no less a tear
On the common cheek with which we smile
Holloweyed on Eddie‚ is it they or is it I?
Is it me who is more hollow as I'm quickly passing by?
And the poison is killing them, but then so am I
As I turn away

The wound has no direction
Everybody needs a home and deserves protection, hmmmm

Sings in a whispering whistle
Sleeps in the ivy and thistle
Owls out swooping and howling
Deep in the midnight aprowling
Mama, the scream of the eagle
Threading my heart through the needle
Threading the blood through the apple
Sucking the juice from the apple
Eating the seeds of the apple
Bearing the tree of the apple
Trapped in the weeds like a scarecrow
Stuck to the wind like Velcro
Distantly hearing the bell toll
Warbling chime through the meadow

Mama, the scream of the eagle
Threading my heart through the needle
Threading the blood through the apple
Eve sucked the juice from the apple
Nakedly running, I saw her
Boy chasing after to stall her
I wish I'd have spoken to call her
Before she found fabric to shawl her
Breasts bound and burdened with fiber
Adam came trembling beside her
And he said, and he said
That she has the poison inside her
She talks to snakes and they guide her
She has the poison inside her
She talks to snakes and they guide her

Silent river pouring backward eternally
Through the phase and touch of entropy
Old age in the beginner
To hit the stage and blush wild, laughingly
Crush the rage and rush time tappingly
Call the name so much so vapidly
Dissolving into thin air
Turning the twofork tapedup television
Into tunnel vision
Taking the new fork tactile as revision
Working the revision

Through distortion's secret telеphone

Poison in the ether
Swinging still incessant pendulum
Lavender, nettle, calendula
Separate, contact, concentrate
Drawing out the fever

Only the winter wind survives
After the heat rush feeds and thrives
After the bushfire burns and dies
Frozen and bitter
Desert ground so cold and clean
Spreading out like a magazine
Reading the dirt like gossip
What do the weeds say? They say
Everything, everything, everything falls through
Each dimension breaks in two
Like the two hands clapping
Like the two wings flapping
Everything, everything, everything for free
As it all eventually
Turns to dust and petal
Molten rock and meadow""

Just something I was made to do
Doesn't matter what dreams come true
I was born for loving you

Sometimes we both disappear
Into that shadow box of fear
That tiny old abyss
From the first kiss to the first fuck
I don't think it's just good luck
Take me to the back of your pickup truck
Show me a thing or two

That's just something I was made to do
Doesn't matter what dreams come true

When the hard times come and the hard times stay
When they stick around and won't go away
When it seems there's nothing you can do or say
Nowhere you can turn
From the last breath of my first death
To this lifetime and lifetimes left
Congratulations, no regrets

Sitting on steps, the topmost
There's a pasture before me
Where the brief shadows of small trees are plain to see at  am
Where the moon lights the back of a head
Bowed in respect of all that is
I'm not sure I want to talk anymore
Maybe there is something I could say a poet would feel
Maybe there's no need
A true poet already sits beside me
Head bowed to the moonlight
I am at once alone and inside everything
Even in the den of the world there is a silence that sings of reverence
There is a space that cannot be described
In that space words are noise:
Substantiated evidence of distraction, a step behind now
An understandable preoccupation of the mind's attempt at solving a mystery
So I am not sure if I want to talk anymore
Some days my heart is heavier than I knew I could bear
Some days it floats beyond gravity's reach
And words are heavy
To use them lets loose an anchor that only proves the science of causality
I know these things
Though the knowing mostly serves as a reminder of an absence
Maybe only momentary, or
Until the moon shines once more on a poet's bowed head
So I am not sure I want much) to talk
There is no sayable clarity
No translation in large print
There is only this moment
And I live inside it alone

Bight my thigh like a wideeyed pit bull
Oh and that night when the moon shone bright on your face
Wearing all your finest and the lace

Would you want me honey if I up and quit the race?

And I'm warming up the car
Ten miles away
Two children of ours
They came twirling in
We laughed very hard, for a while
But they've grown very far
And tall, how we miss them
Though happy they're travelling
And Joe, nothing is real
But we still have that feel

And I'm warming up the car

Naked as the window

In the blood of New York Island

Before this land is my land, before
Before this land is her land, you know

Give me guilt with nowhere to call

Holloweyеd on Eddie Street, no sirens to hear
Just trash and soiled needles clawing the veneer
And no crying but it is no less a tear
On the common cheek with which we smile
Holloweyed on Eddie, is it they or is it I?
Is it me who is more hollow as I'm quickly passing by?
And the poison is killing them, but then so am I
