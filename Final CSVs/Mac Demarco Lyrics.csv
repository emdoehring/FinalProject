Chamber of Reflection,Mac Demarco,Salad Days,"{'year': 2014, 'month': 4, 'day': 1}","
Spend some time away
Getting ready for the day you're born again
Spend some time alone
Understand that soon you'll run with better men
Alone again

Alone again
Alone again
Alone again
Alone

No use looking out
It's within that brings that lonely feeling
Understand that when you leave here
You'll be clear among the better men
Alone again

Alone again
Alone again
Alone again
Alone
Alone again
Alone again
Alone again
Alone"
For the First Time,Mac Demarco,This Old Dog,"{'year': 2017, 'month': 5, 'day': 5}","While she's been away
Living daytoday has been tough
Without her at my side
Simply being alive has been rough

And though she won't be gone forever
There are many times I find it feels that way
And I'm not trying to forget her
Just understand how I'll be feeling on that day

It's just like seeing her for the first time again
It's just like seeing her for the first time again

The time she's not around
Somewhere out of town, has been hard
But somehow this old heart
Found time to work it out this far

No, I know she's coming home soon
There are times I find it hard to feel that way
It's not inside me to forget her
Just understand how I'll be feeling on that day

It's just like seeing her for the first time again
It's just like seeing her for the first time again
It's just like seeing her for the first time again
It's just like seeing her for the first time again"
My Kind of Woman,Mac Demarco,2,"{'year': 2012, 'month': 10, 'day': 16}","Oh, baby
Oh, man
You're making me crazy
Really driving me mad
That's alright with me
It's really no fuss
As long as you're next to me
Just the two of us

You're my, my, my, my kind of woman
My, oh my, what a girl
You're my, my, my, my kind of woman
And I'm down on my hands and knees
Begging you please, baby
Show me your world

Oh, brother
Sweetheart
I'm feeling so tired
Really falling apart
And it just don't make sense to me
I really don't know
Why you stick right next to me
Wherever I go

You're my, my, my, my kind of woman
My, oh my, what a girl
You're my, my, my, my kind of woman
And I'm down on my hands and knees
Begging you please, baby
Show me your world"
Salad Days,Mac Demarco,Salad Days,"{'year': 2014, 'month': 4, 'day': 1}","As Im getting older, chip up on my shoulder
Rolling through life, to roll over and die
Missing Hippie Jon, salad days are gone
Remembering things just to tell em so long

Oh mama, actin’ like my lifes already over
Oh dear, act your age and try another year

Always feeling tired, smiling when required
Write another year off and kindly resign
Salad days are gone, missing Hippie Jon
Remember the days just to tell em so long

Oh mama, actin’ like my lifes already over
Oh dear, act your age and try another year
Oh mama, actin’ like my lifes already over
Oh dear, act your age and try another year"
Freaking Out the Neighbourhood,Mac Demarco,2,"{'year': 2012, 'month': 9, 'day': 18}","Sorry, mama
There are times I get carried away
Please, don't worry
Next time I'm home, I'll still be the same

And I know it's no fun
When your first son
Gets up to no good
Starts freaking out the neighborhood

Really, I'm fine
Never been better, got no job on the line
Sincerely, don't worry
Same old boy that you hoped you would find

And I know it's no fun
When your first son
Gets up to no good
Starts freaking out the neighborhood"
Still Beating,Mac Demarco,This Old Dog,"{'year': 2017, 'month': 5, 'day': 5}","I never meant to make her cry
And now I'm seeing tears in her eyes
Half and half, make believe
'Cause so she thought, well, my heart was on my sleeve

Honey, I cried, too
You better believe it
Honey, my heart still beats for you
Even though you don't feel it
Beating

Never thought some silly songs
Could ever go and hurt someone
I never meant to sing my tune
For anybody else out there but you

Honey, I cried, too
You better believe it
Honey, my heart still beats for you
Even though you don't feel it
Honey, I cried, too
You better believe it
Honey, my heart still beats for you
Even though you don't feel it beating"
This Old Dog,Mac Demarco,This Old Dog,"{'year': 2017, 'month': 1, 'day': 31}","Sometimes my love may be put on hold
Sometimes my heart may seem awful cold
These times come and these times go
As long as I live, all you need to know is

This old dog ain't about to forget
All we've had, and all that's next
'Long as my heart's beatin' in my chest
This old dog ain't about to forget

Often a heart tends to change its mind
A new day decides on a new design
A new day gets set on another way
As long as I live, all I've got to say is

This old dog ain't about to forget
All we've had, and all that's next
'Long as my heart's beatin' in my chest
This old dog ain't about to forget"
Ode to Viceroy,Mac Demarco,2,"{'year': 2012, 'month': 10, 'day': 10}","Viceroy
Early in the morning
Just trying to let the sun in
And open up my eyes
Viceroy
As it's getting later
Heading for the corner
Already running dry

And oh, don't let me see you crying
'Cause oh, honey, I'll smoke you 'til I'm dying

Viceroy
Don't take me for a fool now
I'm only trying to calm down
Just trying to keep it cool
Viceroy
As it's getting later
Heading for the corner
I'm leaving it to you

And oh, don't let me see you crying
'Cause oh, honey, I'll smoke you 'til I'm dying

There really is nothing quite like it."""
Moonlight on the River,Mac Demarco,This Old Dog,"{'year': 2017, 'month': 5, 'day': 5}","I'd say, see you later, if I thought I'd see you later
And I'd tell you, that I loved you, if I did
It's so strange, deciding, how to feel about it
It's such strange emotion standing there beside it

I'm home, with moonlight on the river, saying my goodbyes
Home, there's moonlight on the river, everybody dies

I'd say, see you next time, if I thought there were a next time
Easy conversation, ain't exactly where we're at
It's so strange, deciding, how I feel about you
It ain't like I ain't used to going on without you

I'm home, with moonlight on the river, saying my goodbyes
I'm home, there's moonlight on the river, everybody dies
I'm home, with moonlight on the river, saying my goodbyes
I'm home, there's moonlight on the river, everybody dies

Another One,Mac Demarco,Another One,"{'year': 2015, 'month': 6, 'day': 16}","Feelin' so confused
You don't know what to do
Afraid she might not love you anymore
And though she says she does
And hasn't lost your trust
Who could that be knockin' at her door?

Must be another one
Must be another one she loves
Must be another one
Must be another one she loves

The feelin' never stops
And neither does the clock
Wishin' for tomorrow today
She still says she's true
So you start comin' to
Just as that old knockin' comes to stay

Must be another one
Must be another one she loves
Must be another one
Must be another one she loves"
Heart to Heart,Mac Demarco,Here Comes The Cowboy,"{'year': 2019, 'month': 5, 'day': 10}","To all the days we were together
To all the time we were apart
Of each other's lives, heart to heart
And so I had a late arrival
So we never saw the start
Of each other's lives, heart to heart

Heart to heart, heart to heart
Heart to heart, heart to heart

And though it seems so quick and easy
Sentimentally assumed
Walking parallels, heart to heart
To all the days we were together
To all the time we played apart
In each other's lives, heart to heart

Heart to heart, heart to heart
Heart to heart, heart to heart
Heart to heart, heart to heart
Heart to heart, heart to heart

Weo! Weo! Weo! Weo!
Hehheh"
One More Love Song,Mac Demarco,This Old Dog,"{'year': 2017, 'month': 4, 'day': 27}","Another turn, another shift
One last kiss from her lips
Another dream you're putting down
After all this time, it turns out all you found

Is one more love out to break your heart
Set it up just to watch it fall apart

Another try, another go
Never thought you'd feel this low
Another dream put to bed
After all this time, it turns out all you had

Is one more love out to break your heart
Set it up just to watch it fall apart
One more love out to break your heart
Set it up just to watch it fall apart

Garlic bread"
Watching Him Fade Away,Mac Demarco,This Old Dog,"{'year': 2017, 'month': 5, 'day': 5}","Haven't got the guts to call him up
Walk around as if you never cared in the first place
But if you never call, you'll end up stuck
Without another chance to tell him off right to his face

And even though we barely know each other
It still hurts watching him fade away, watching him fade away
Watching him fade away, watching him fade away

I know you never meant to put him down
And even if you did, he sure deserved it
The thought of him no longer being around
Well, sure, it would be sad but not really different

And even though we barely know each other
It still hurts watching him fade away, watching him fade away
Watching him fade away, watching him fade away"
Let My Baby Stay,Mac Demarco,Salad Days,"{'year': 2014, 'month': 4, 'day': 1}","I was made to love her
Been working at it
Half of my life
Ive been an addict

And shes been good to me
Far as I can tell shes happy
Livin’ with her Macky

So please dont take my love away
Let my baby stay
Let my baby stay
Please dont take my love away
Let my baby stay
Let my baby stay

And where would I be
Feeling lonely
Separated from my one and only

And whats there left to say
Far as I can tell that day
Could be on its way

So please dont take my love away
Let my baby stay
Let my baby stay
Please dont take my love away
Let my baby stay
Let my baby stay

No Other Heart,Mac Demarco,Another One,"{'year': 2015, 'month': 7, 'day': 20}","Is it true?
Youve been feeling sort of low these days
Just dont have a place to go these days
Must be bringing you down

If its so
Then come on give this lover boy a try
Ill put the sparkle right back in your eyes
What could you lose?
Well, for one, her heart belongs to another
And no other heart will do

Is it wrong
To think my love could really help you out?
Its simply just my stubborn heart, no doubt, rambling away

If its not
Then come on give this lover boy a try
Ill put the sparkle right back in your eyes
What could you lose?

Well, for one, her heart belongs to another
And no other heart will do
For one, her heart belongs to another
And no other heart will do

Oh
Ah"
Treat Her Better,Mac Demarco,Salad Days,"{'year': 2014, 'month': 4, 'day': 1}","Hey, man
Heard you were your brother's keeper
That can't be
Judgin' by the way you treat her

Oh no, you've done it again
No use when you already know how it ends

Treat her better, boy
If havin' her at your side's something you enjoy
If havin' her in your life's really so important to you now

Hey, man
Who's been keepin' brother?
Hey, man, how old is your mother?

Oh no, you've done it again
No use when you already know how it ends

Treat her better, boy
If havin' her at your side's something you enjoy
If havin' her in your life's really so important to you now
Treat her better, boy
If havin' her at your side's something you enjoy
If havin' her in your life's really so important to you now

Treat her better, boy

My Old Man,Mac Demarco,This Old Dog,"{'year': 2017, 'month': 1, 'day': 31}","Look in the mirror
Who do you see?
Someone familiar
But surely not me
For he can't be me
Look how old and cold and tired
And lonely he's become
Not until you see
There's a price tag hanging off of having all that fun

Uhoh, looks like I'm seeing more of my old man in me
Oh no, looks like I'm seeing more of my old man in me

Walk on the outside, holding her hand
Someone familiar, her and her man
But it just can't be
Look at all the steps that brought you where you are today
Not until you see
As a heart grows stronger, sometimes love is pushed away

Uhoh, looks like I'm seeing more of my old man in me
Oh no, looks like I'm seeing more of my old man in me
Uhoh, looks like I'm seeing more of my old man in me
Oh no, looks like I'm seeing more of my old man in me"
Blue Boy,Mac Demarco,Salad Days,"{'year': 2014, 'month': 4, 'day': 1}","Blue Boy, worried 'bout the world's eyes
Worried, every time the sun shines
Worried 'bout his haircut
Calm down, sweetheart, grow up

Blue Boy
Blue Boy
Blue Boy
Blue Boy

Blue Boy, older than the world knows
Honey, that's the way that life goes
No use acting so tough
Calm down, sweetheart, grow up

Blue Boy

Hey, Tony"
Let Her Go,Mac Demarco,Salad Days,"{'year': 2014, 'month': 4, 'day': 1}","Tell her that you love her
If you really love her
But if your heart just ain't sure
Let her know

Growing by the hour
Love just like a flower
But when the flower dies
You've got to say goodbye
And let her go

Let her go
Let her go

Tell her that you'll be there
If you'll really be there
Separation's supposed to
Make the heart grow fond
But it don't

So tell her that you love her
If you really love her
But if your heart just ain't sure
Let her go

Let her go
Let her go
Let her go
Let her go
Yeah!

Or you can keep her
It's okay
It's up to you
Make your own choice
But you got it
God bless"
Passing Out Pieces,Mac Demarco,Salad Days,"{'year': 2014, 'month': 1, 'day': 21}","Watching my life, passing right in front of my eyes
Hell of a story, or is it boring?
Can't claim to care, never been reluctant to share
Passing out pieces of me, don't you know nothing comes free?

What Mom don't know has taken its toll on me
It's all I've seen that can't be wiped clean
It's hard to believe what it's made of me

Passing my life, living it out with her side
Listening closely, hearing her mostly
Cant shake concern, seems that every time that I turn
I'm passing out pieces of me, don't you know nothing comes free?

What Mom don't know has taken its toll on me
It's all I've seen that can't be wiped clean
It's hard to believe what it's made of me"
Cooking Up Something Good,Mac Demarco,2,"{'year': 2012, 'month': 10, 'day': 16}","Mommy's in the kitchen, cooking up something good
And daddy's on the sofa, pride of the neighborhood
My brother's in the ballet, it seems he's got it set
And I'll be up at midnight with my cigarette

Ooh when life moves this slowly
Ooh just try and let it go
Ooh when life moves this slowly
Ooh just try and let it go

Daddy's in the basement, cooking up something fine
While Rick's out on the pavement, flipping it for dimes
If there's anything redeeming, I haven't seen it yet
And I'm still up at midnight, chewing nicorette

Ooh when life moves this slowly
Ooh just try and let it go
Ooh when life moves this slowly
Ooh just try and let it go"
On the Level,Mac Demarco,This Old Dog,"{'year': 2017, 'month': 4, 'day': 11}","Boy, this could be your year
Make an old man proud of you, forget about the tears
On the level, see me eyetoeye
Stand up like a man even from the other side

On the level
On the level

Man, I never had a choice
Never had a chance, never had a voice
On the level, carrying a name
Fall until my final day, now, who's there left to blame?

On the level
On the level
On the level
On the level
On the level
On the level
On the level"
Still Together,Mac Demarco,2,"{'year': 2012, 'month': 10, 'day': 16}","In time she'll see that her and me
Were meant to be, together
And time will pass, it may go fast
But we'll still be together
And where I go she's at my side, half of my life, together
It's easy love, fits like a glove from up above, together

Together
Together

I've had my share, it's just not fair
That we should be together
But if it's fine, that I've done my time
Let's walk the line together
And when she's low, I'll always know
We'll always go together
It's easy love, fits like a glove from up above, together

Together
Together
Together
Together

Mac: Kiki. Kiki? Hey. Time for bed. You're sleeping! Let's go. Ready?
Kiki: I have a bruise there
Mac: Yeah, you got a little indentation from the glasses that you fell asleep with on your face. I love you"
One Another,Mac Demarco,This Old Dog,"{'year': 2017, 'month': 5, 'day': 5}","Hey kid, everybody's prone to some mistakes
If you'd always kept it straight, you'd never learn
You'd run the risk of all the risks you take
Don't feel like all the time you put in went to waste
The way your heart was beating all those days
And suddenly it beats another pace

It's not like you'd ever try to forget her
But these days are better without one another

Hey man, so now you've got it off your chest
Your heart can finally get some rest
Same heart that started this whole mess
And although, a broken heart needs time to mend
Yours wasn't ever really broken, was it?
You lose a love, you gain a friend

It's not like you'd ever try to forget her
But these days are better without one another

Without one another
Without one another
Without one another"
Nobody,Mac Demarco,Here Comes The Cowboy,"{'year': 2019, 'month': 3, 'day': 5}","I'm the preacher
A done decision
Another creature
Who's lost its vision

Let it go
Reel it in
For the creature
On television

There's no turning back
To nobody
There's no second chance
No third degree

I'm a fixture
A split decision
A pretty picture
A superstition

Let it go
Cash it in
For the creature
On television

There's no turning back
To nobody
There's no second chance
No third degree
There's no turning back
To nobody
There's no second chance
No third degree"

To take my advice

To take it slowly, brother
Let it go now, brother
Take it slowly, brother

From nine until five

A Heart Like Hers,Mac Demarco,Another One,"{'year': 2015, 'month': 8, 'day': 7}","Done, done is all the love, love that I had saved for you
Gone, gone with my heart, locked inside a cage for you
And what's this that has become, has become of poor old me
Tried, so hard to believe in something that will never be

Never believe in a heart like hers again
Never believe in a heart like hers again
Never believe in a  heart like hers again
Never believe

All, all that I could give, all I had to offer her
Is gone, simply locked away, no longer there to bother her
Now look, look at what's become, what's become of poor old me
Tried, so hard to believe in something that will never be

Never believe in a heart like hers again
Never believe in a heart like hers again

Baby You’re Out,Mac Demarco,This Old Dog,"{'year': 2017, 'month': 5, 'day': 5}","Of all the things you wished you'd never done
I've heard you say that this is number one
Another life down another road
Perhaps you're better off to never know

Don't dream of all the ways things could have been
Remember all the faces you let in
Remember all the faces still unseen
And soon enough, you'll see just what I mean

There's nothing to cry about
'Cause baby, baby, you're out

You've always felt it's hard to voice complaints
But what you voice is what will drive your fate
And though things never really got that bad
Dreams of greener grass'll drive you mad

Don't dream of all the ways things could've been
Remember all the faces you let in
Remember all the faces still unseen
And soon enough, you'll see just what I mean

There's nothing to cry about

Baby, you're out
Baby, you're out"

Goodbye Weekend,Mac Demarco,Salad Days,"{'year': 2014, 'month': 4, 'day': 1}","Goodbye,  weekend
So long, darling
Macky's been a bad, bad boy
And when they're preaching
Be sure to change me
Should rearrange me
Or so they thought

So don't go telling me how this boy should be leading
His own life
Sometimes rough but generally speaking I'm fine
If you don't agree with the things that go on within my life
Well, honey, that's fine just know that you're wasting your time

Sort me, place me
Give me a sign
Repeat the mantra
When you're stepping out of line
Give me, a number
Something to be
May help out the country boy
But it won't work out on me


So don't go telling me how this boy should be leading
His own life
Sometimes rough but generally speaking I'm fine
If you don't agree with the things that go on within my life
Well, honey, that's fine just know that you're wasting your time

The Way You’d Love Her,Mac Demarco,Another One,"{'year': 2015, 'month': 5, 'day': 11}","How's your heart been beating?
How's your skin been keeping?
How's the dream been going since you've came back home this time?
You left her out there somewhere
Told her how you feel but
Never really got the chance to show her what it really means to love her

The way you'd love her
The way you'd love to love her
The way you'd love her

Closer to the ending
She's still out pretending
Prying eyes won't recognize the way she feels about him
She'll just go on living
The river keeps on rolling
Knowing all the time she'll never understand just what it means to love her

The way you'd love her
The way you'd love to love her
The way you'd love her

Love her
The way you'd love her
The way you'd love to love her
The way you'd love her"
Dreams from Yesterday,Mac Demarco,This Old Dog,"{'year': 2017, 'month': 5, 'day': 5}","Once your dreams
Come knocking at your door
It's time to realize
You aren't dreaming anymore
And once your life is set to settle down
Take a look around you
No more dreaming to be found

So why, then, are you crying?
It was you who denied them
And no amount of tears
Could roll back all the years
Bring back all your dreams from yesterday

Once a life believes it's got it set up
A closer look reveals
Just how empty you can feel
Once a dream
Is finally put to bed
Rest up, sleepyhead
You might as well be dead

So why, then, are you crying?
It was you who denied them
And no amount of tears
Could roll back all the years
Bring back all your dreams from yesterday"

Baby remember
Maybe I'm out of luck
Maybe it's running still

K, settle down, turn around, and take this song, and let it play

Got to know your heart, baby
Still so much for me to learn
And as I do, my love stays with you
And surely I'd be dumb, baby
Had I made another turn
Glad the turn that I made was you

I was a fool to care
But I don't care even if I was a fool

Still in love with you
Had I listened to the grape vine
I might have had my doubts
But I tried my level best just to block them out
'Cause love is so unwise
Love has no eyes
It took a while for a fool to see what his friends were on about

I was a fool to care
I was a fool to care
I was a fool to care
But I don't care even if I was a fool

Still in love with you
Imagining your face
It almost fills the empty space before me
I can see your eyes, almost hear your lovely lies

I wish I was an old man
Love was through with me
I wish I was a baby on my mama's knee
I wish I was a freight train moving down the line
Just to keep in track of time
Without all these memories

I was a fool to care
I was a fool to care
I was a fool to care
And I don't care even if I was a fool

Still in love with you, baby yes I am
I could've opened my eyes
Could've seen through your lies
Could've stood for no more
Could've walked out the door

I was a fool to care
I was a fool to care
I was a fool to care
I was a fool to care
I was a fool) You were nothing but a fool to care
I was a fool) Just a country fool to care

It's sad to see your heart divided
Little use in trying to hide it
Sharing one last dance with you has proved
It's not as though I understand
Another day, some new demand
On the path of love, a heart will choose

It chose you
You
No doubt about it
You
It chose you
You
No doubt about it
You"

For what it is now
Made me believe in love again
Boy, it's been years now
But debts that I owe to my old days
Won't go away so soon
So I'd better go, leave her alone
And keep my heart from the truth
The truth

She saw me how I believed
Nobody could now
I'm so relieved, or so it seems
Everything's clear now
The debts that I owe to my old days
Won't go away so soon
So I'd better go reap what I've sewn
And keep my heart from the truth

Those lashes and cotton

Getting hard to remember
Getting hard to recall
Getting laid off and pushed out
And it ain't my baby's fault

And if you go, don't cry
I'll be right there at your side

Getting laid on the lifeline
Getting tired, time for bed
And there's no use getting worked up
I'll remember all you said

And if you go, don't cry
I'll be right there at your side
