The Alcott,The National,First Two Pages of Frankenstein,"{'year': 2023, 'month': 4, 'day': 28}","I get myself twisted in threads
To meet you at The Alcott
I'd go to the corner in the back
Where you'd always be
And there you are, sittin' as usual
With your golden notebook
Writin' something about someone
Who used to be me

And the last thing you wanted
Is the first thing I do
I tell you my problems
You tell me the truth
It's the last thing you wanted
It's the first thing I do
I tell you that I think I'm fallin'
Back in love with you

I sit there silently
Waitin' for you to look up Ah)
I see you smile
When you see it's me
I had to do something
To break into your golden thinking Ah)
How many times will I do this
And you'll still believe? Ah)

It's the last thing you wanted
Tell me, which side are you on, dear?)
It's the first thing you do
Give me some tips to forget you)
You tell me your problems
Have I become one of your problems?)
And I tell you the truth
Could it be easy this once?)
It's the last thing you wanted
Everything that's mine is a landmine)
It's the first thing I do
Did my love aid and abet you?)
I tell you that I think I'm fallin'
Back in love with you

And I'll ruin it all over
I'll ruin it for you
I'll ruin it all over
And over like I always do
I'll ruin it all over
Why don't you rain on my parade?)
I'll ruin it for you
Shred my evening gown)
I'll ruin it all over
Read my sentence out loud)
And over like I always do

I don't see what's strange about this
Tiny bubbles hang above me

Everything I love is out to sea

I have only two emotions
Careful fear and dead devotion
I can't get the balance right
With all my marbles in the fight
I see all the ones I went for
All the things I had it in for
I won't cry until I hear

I say a bright, white, beautiful heaven hanging over me

I couldn't see you coming so far
I just turn around and there you are

I was just getting used to living life without you around
I'm so surprised you want to dance with me now

The sight of you among the sights
I get the sudden sinking feeling
Of a man about to fly

Now I've been awake for days
I can't fight it anymore
I'm going through an awkward phase
I am secretly in love with
Everyone that I grew up with
I do my crying underwater
I can't get down any farther
All my drowning friends can see
Now there is no running from it
It's become the crux of me
I wish that I could rise above it

But I stay down with my demons
I stay down with my demons

Bats and buzzards in the sky
Alligators in the sewers
I don't even wonder why
I hide among the younger viewers
I huddle with them all night long
The worried talk to God goes on
I sincerely tried to love it
I wish that I could rise above it

But I stay down with my demons
I stay down with my demons
I stay down with my demons
I stay down with my demons

Can I stay here? I can sleep on the floor
Paint the blood and hang the palms on the door
I do not think I'm going places anymore
I wanna see the sun come up above New York
Oh, every day I start so great, and then the sunlight dims
The less I look, the more I see the pythons in the limbs
I do not know what's wrong with me, the sour is in the cut
When I walk into a room, I do not light it up
Fuck

So I stay down with my demons
I stay down with my demons
I stay down with my demons
I stay down with my demons"

I should leave it alone, but you're not right
I should leave it alone, but you're not right

I should live in salt for leaving you behind, behind

You think about something so much

Way out of sync from the beginning

I wanna hurry home to you
Put on a slow, dumb show for you
And crack you up
So you can put a blue ribbon on my brain
God, I'm very, very frightened
I'll overdo it

Looking for somewhere to stand and stay
I leaned on the wall and the wall leaned away
Can I get a minute of not being nervous
And not thinking of my dick?
My leg is sparkles, my leg is pins
I better get my shit together, better gather my shit in
You could drive a car through my head in five minutes
From one side of it to the other

I wanna hurry home to you
Put on a slow, dumb show for you
And crack you up
So you can put a blue ribbon on my brain
God, I'm very, very frightened
I'll overdo it

That's not the way the world really works anymore. We're an empire now, and when we act, we create our own reality. And while you are studying that realityjudiciously, as you willwe'll act again, creating other new realities, which you can study too, and that's how things will sort out.

Weird Goodbyes,The National,Laugh Track,"{'year': 2022, 'month': 8, 'day': 22}","Memorize the bathwater, memorize the air

Get it down to nothing, everything that matters
Fever flashes, eyelashes and traffic patterns
Humidity, history, chemistry and panic
Swimsuits in the windows of electric minivans

I don't know why I don't try harder
I've been going down some, some strange water

Move forward now, there's nothing to do
Can't turn around, I can't follow you
Your coat's in my car, I guess you forgot
It's crazy the things we let go of

It finally hits me, a mile's drive
The sky is leaking, my windshield's cryin'
I'm feeling sacred, my soul is stripped
Radio's painful, the words are clipped
The grief, it gets me, the weird goodbyes
My car is creeping, I think it's dyin'
I'm pulling over until it heals
I'm on a shoulder of lemon fields

What was I even leaving for?
I keep going back and forth
I think now I'm about to see
Didn't know how sad it'd be

Can't pay attention to the sound of anyone
A little more stupid, a little more scared
Every minute, more unprepared
I made a mistake in my life today
Everything I love gets lost in the drawers
I want to start over, I want to be winning
Way out of sync from the beginning

I wanna hurry home to you
Put on a slow, dumb show for you
And crack you up
So you can put a blue ribbon on my brain
God, I'm very, very frightened
I'll overdo it

Looking for somewhere to stand and stay
I leaned on the wall and the wall leaned away
Can I get a minute of not being nervous
And not thinking of my dick?
My leg is sparkles, my leg is pins
I better get my shit together, better gather my shit in
You could drive a car through my head in five minutes
From one side of it to the other

I wanna hurry home to you
Put on a slow, dumb show for you
And crack you up
So you can put a blue ribbon on my brain

The more I cannot stand me

No point of view or vision

I swear you got a little bit taller since I saw you

Gave me a reason to get out of the city
See you inside watching swarms on TV

I gave my heart to the Army
The only sentimental thing I could think of
With cousins in colors and somewhere overseas
But it'll take a better war to kill a college man like me

I'm too tired to drive anywhere
Anyway right now, do you care if I stay?
You can put on your bathing suits
And I'll try to find somethin' on this thing that means nothin' enough

Lay me on the table, put flowers in my mouth
And we can say that we invented a summer lovin' torture party

People like you are still living in what we call the realitybased community. You believe that solutions emerge from your judicious study of discernible reality. That's not the way the world really works anymore. We're an empire now, and when we act, we create our own reality. And while you are studying that realityjudiciously, as you willwe'll act again, creating other new realities, which you can study too, and that's how things will sort out. We're history's actors, and you, all of you, will be left to just study what we do

Into the rabbit hole
I said I would but then I saw
Your shivered bones
They didn't want me to

Is it dissolvable and tasteless?
You can't imagine how I hate this
I'm trying to baseless
Graceless
I'm trying, but I'm graceless
I don't have the sunny side to face this
I am invisible and weightless
You can't imagine how I hate this, graceless

I'm trying, but I'm gone, through the glass again
Just come and find me
God loves everybody, don't remind me
I took the medicine and I went missing
Just let me hear your voice, just let mе listen

Graceless
I figurеd out how to be faithless
But it would be a shame to waste this
You can't imagine how I hate this, graceless

I'm trying, but I'm gone
Through the glass again
Just come and find me
God loves everybody, don't remind me
I took the medicine and I went missing
Just let me hear your voice, just let me listen

All of my thoughts of you
Bullets through rotten fruit
Come apart at the seams
Now I know what dying means
I am not my rosy self
Left my roses on my shelf
Take the white ones, they're my favorite
It's the side effects that save us

Grace
Put the flowers you find in a vase
If you're dead in the mind, it'll brighten the place
Don't let them die on the vine, it's a waste

Now I know what dying means

Left my roses on the shelf
Take the white ones, they're my favorite

I'm always checking out
I'm always mothering myself to bits
I'm always checking out

Forget it, nothing I change changes anything
I won't let it, I won't let it ruin my hair

I only take up a little of the collapsing space
I better cut this off, don't wanna fuck it up
I only take up a little of the collapsing space
I better cut this off, don't wanna fuck up the place

I better walk it back, walk it back
Oh, I better walk it back, walk it back, walk it back, walk it back

I try to save it for a rainy day
It's raining all the time
Until everything is less insane
I'm mixing weed with wine

People like you are still living in what we call the realitybased community. You believe that solutions emerge from your judicious study of discernible reality. That's not the way the world really works anymore. We're an empire now, and when we act, we create our own reality. And while you are studying that realityjudiciously, as you willwe'll act again, creating other new realities, which you can study too, and that's how things will sort out. We're history's actors, and you, all of you, will be left to just study what we do
Apparently that was written on a whiteboard with a red sharpie in the Roosevelt bedroom, sometime around Christmas . Yeah, so I can't stay…""

I can't stay and I can't come back
I'll just keep awake
And I won't react
I'll walk through Lawrencetown
Along the tracks
My own body in my arms
But I won't collapse
So don't go dark on me
It's all alright
If I'm gonna get back to you, someday
I'll need your light

Red sun saint around your neck
A wet martini in a paper cup

And all your wrath and cutting beauty
You're poison in the pretty glass

Under your killing clothes
Get over here I wanna
Kiss your skinny throat
