The Adults Are Talking,The Strokes,The New Abnormal,"{'year': 2020, 'month': 4, 'day': 10}","They've been sayin' you're sophisticated
They're complainin', overeducated
You are saying all the words I'm dreaming
Say it after me
Say it after me
They will blame us, crucify and shame us
We can't help it if we are a problem
We are tryin' hard to get your attention
I'm climbin' up your wall
Climbin' up your wall

Don't go there 'cause you'll never return
I know you think of me when you think of her
But then it don't make sense when you're trying hard
To do the right thing, but without recompense
And then you did something wrong and you said it was great
And now you don't know how you could ever complain
Because you're all confused 'cause you want me to
But then you want me to do it the same as you

You were waitin' for the elevator
You were sayin' all the words I'm dreaming
No more askin', questions, or excuses
The information's here
Here and everywhere

Don't go there 'cause you'll never return
I know you think of me when you think of her
But then it dont make sense when you're trying hard
To do the right thing but without recompense
And then you did something wrong and you said it was great
And now you don't know how you could ever complain
Because you're all confused 'cause you want me to
But then you want me to do it the same way as you, and but

I don't, I don't want anything
I know it's not, it's not your fault
I don't want anyone
As I do it's not for you

Ah, ahahahah
Ahah, ooh, ooh

Stockholders
Same shit, a different life
I'll get it right sometime
Oh, maybe not tonight
Oh, maybe not tonight
Oh, maybe not tonight
Oh, maybe not tonight
Oh, maybe not tonight
Yeah boy, here we go
And a one, and a two, and a three
Here we go friends Hold on, I can't)
Maybe that's a kooky situation
So let's go back to the old key, old tempo, everything"
Someday,The Strokes,Is This It,"{'year': 2001, 'month': 7, 'day': 30}","In many ways, they'll miss the good old days
Someday, someday
Yeah, it hurts to say, but I want you to stay
Sometimes, sometimes
When we was young, oh man, did we have fun
Always, always
Promises, they break before they're made
Sometimes, sometimes

Oh, Maya says I'm lackin' in depth
I will do my best
You say you wanna stand by my side
Darling, your head's not right
I see alone we stand, together we fall apart
Yeah, I think I'll be alright
I'm workin' so I won't have to try so hard
Tables, they turn sometimes
Oh, someday
No, I ain't wastin' no more time

Tryin', tryin')

And now my fears, they come to me in threes
So I sometimes
Say, Fate, my friend, you say the strangest things
I find sometimes""

Ode to the Mets,The Strokes,The New Abnormal,"{'year': 2020, 'month': 4, 'day': 10}","Up on his horse, up on his horse
Not gonna wake up here anymore
Listen one time, it's not the truth
It's just a story I tell to you
Easy to say, easy to do
But it's not easy, well, maybe for you
Hope that you find it, hope that it's good
Hope that you read it, think that you should
Cuts you some slack as he sits back
Sizes you up, plans his attack

Dadada
Drums please, Fab

And I got it all, I got it all
Waitin' for me down on the street
But now you gotta do somethin' special for me
I'm gonna say what's on my mind
Then I'll walk out, then I'll feel fine

Yeah, I'm under his thumb, I'm on his back
I will not show my teeth too quick
I needed you there, I needed you there
But I didn't know, I didn't know

Go alone
I'll go alone
We'll go alone
I'll go alone

Back from his trip, he's at the door
When he gets back, he's on the phone
Innocent eye, innocent heart
No, it's not wrong, but it's not right
Innocent time, out on his own
Not gonna do that, fuck, I'm out of control
I was just bored, playin' the guitar
Learned all your tricks, wasn't too hard

It's the last one now, I can promise you that
I'm gonna find out the truth when I get back

Gone now are the old times
Forgotten, time to hold on the railing
The Rubik's Cube isn't solving for us
Old friends, long forgotten
The old ways at the bottom of
The ocean now has swallowed
The only thing that's left is us
So pardon the silence that you're hearing
It's turnin' into a deafening, painful, shameful roar"

I can't tell you what and where
