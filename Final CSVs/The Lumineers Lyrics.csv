Ophelia,The Lumineers,Cleopatra,"{'year': 2016, 'month': 2, 'day': 4}","Ah, ah, when I was younger
I, I should've known better
And I can't feel no remorse
And you don't feel nothing back

I, I got a new girlfriend here
Feels like he's on top
And I don't feel no remorse
And you can't see past my blindness

Oh, Ophelia
You've been on my mind, girl, since the flood
Oh, Ophelia
Heaven help the fool who falls in love

I, I got a little paycheck
You got big plans and you gotta move Whoo!)
And I don't feel nothing at all
And you can't feel nothing small

Honey, I love you""
That's all she wrote

Oh, Ophelia
You've been on my mind, girl, like a drug
Oh, Ophelia
Heaven help the fool who falls in love
Oh, Ophelia
You've been on my mind, girl, since the flood
Oh, Ophelia
Heaven help the fool who falls in love
Oh, Ophelia
You've been on my mind, girl, like a drug
Oh, Ophelia
Heaven help the fool who falls in love"
Cleopatra,The Lumineers,Cleopatra,"{'year': 2016, 'month': 3, 'day': 25}","I was Cleopatra, I was young and an actress
When you knelt by my mattress, and asked for my hand
But I was sad you asked it, as I laid in a black dress
With my father in a casket, I had no plans
And I left the footprints, the mud stained on the carpet
And it hardened like my heart did when you left town
But I must admit it, that I would marry you in an instant
Damn your wife, I'd be your mistress just to have you around

But I was late for this, late for that, late for the love of my life
And when I die alone, when I die alone, when I die I'll be on time

While the church discouraged, any lust that burned within me
Yes my flesh, it was my currency, but I held true
So I drive a taxi, and the traffic distracts me
From the strangers in my backseat, they remind me of you

But I was late for this, late for that, late for the love of my life
And when I die alone, when I die alone, when I die I'll be on time

And the only gifts from my Lord were a birth and a divorce
But I've read this script and the costume fits, so I'll play my part

I was Cleopatra, I was taller than the rafters
But that's all in the past now, gone with the wind
Now a nurse in white shoes leads me back to my guestroom
It's a bed and a bathroom
And a place for the end

I won't be late for this, late for that, late for the love of my life
And when I die alone, when I die alone, when I die I'll be on time"

Sleep on the Floor,The Lumineers,Cleopatra,"{'year': 2016, 'month': 4, 'day': 8}","Pack yourself a toothbrush, dear
Pack yourself a favorite blouse
Take a withdrawal slip, take all of your savings out
'Cause if we don't leave this town
We might never make it out
I was not born to drown, baby come on

Forget what Father Brennan said
We were not born in sin
Leave a note on your bed
Let your mother know you're safe
And by the time she wakes
We'll have driven through the state
We'll have driven through the night
Baby, come on

If the Sun don't shine on me today
And if the subways flood and bridges break
Will you lay yourself down and dig your grave
Or will you rail against your dying day?

And when we looked outside, couldn't even see the sky
How do you pay the rent, is it your parents
Or is it hard work dear
Holding the atmosphere
I don't wanna live like that

If the Sun don't shine on me today
If the subways flood and the bridges break

Jesus Christ can't save me tonight
Put on your dress, yes wear something nice
Decide on me, yeah decide on us
Oh, oh, oh, Illinois, Illinois

Pack yourself a toothbrush, dear
Pack yourself a favorite blouse
Take a withdrawal slip, take all of your savings out

We might never make it out"
Stubborn Love,The Lumineers,The Lumineers (Deluxe Edition) ,"{'year': 2012, 'month': 4, 'day': 3}","She'll lie and steal and cheat
And beg you from her knees
Make you think she means it this time
She'll tear a hole in you
The one you can't repair
But I still love her, I don't really care

When we were young, ohoh, we did enough
When it got cold, oohooh, we bundled up
I can't be told, ahah, it can't be done

It's better to feel pain
Than nothing at all
The opposite of love is indifference
So pay attention now
I'm standing on your porch screamin' out
And I won't leave until you come downstairs

So keep your head up, keep your love
Keep your head up, my love
Keep your head up, my love
Keep your head up, keep your love

And I don't blame you, dear
For runnin' like you did all these years
I would do the same, you best believe
And the highway signs say we're close
But I don't read those things anymore
I never trusted my own eyes

When we were young, ohoh, we did enough
When it got cold, oohooh, we bundled up
I can't be told, ahah, it can't be done

So keep your head up, keep your love
Keep your head up, my love
Keep your head up, my love
Keep your head up, keep your love

Head up, love
Head up, love
Head up, love
Head up, love"
Angela,The Lumineers,Cleopatra,"{'year': 2016, 'month': 4, 'day': 8}","When you left this town, with your windows down
And the wilderness inside
Let the exits pass, all the tar and glass
'Til the road and sky align

The strangers in this town
They raise you up just to cut you down
Oh, Angela, it's a long time coming

And your Volvo lights lit up green and white
With the cities on the signs
But you held your course to some distant war
In the corners of your mind

From the second time around
The only love I ever found
Oh Angela it's a long time coming

Home at last

Were you safe and warm in your coat of arms
With your fingers in a fist
Did you hear the notes, all those static codes
In the radio abyss?

Strangers in this town
They raise you up just to cut you down
Oh Angela it's a long time coming
Oh Angela spent your whole life running away

Home at last
Home at last

Vacancy, hotel room, lost in me, lost in you
Angela, on my knee, I belong, I believe

Home at last
Home at last
Home at last
Home at last

Home at last

Slow It Down,The Lumineers,The Lumineers (Deluxe Edition) ,"{'year': 2012, 'month': 4, 'day': 3}","I feel her filth in my bones
Wash off my hands 'til it's gone
The walls, they're closin' in
With velvet curtains

Some love was made for the lights
Some kiss your cheek and goodnight
Lift up a red high heel
Lock up your doors with steel

They're makin' noise in my street
My blinds are drawn, I can't see
Smashed in my car window
Didn't touch the stereo

Slow it down, Angie come back to bed
Rest your arms, and rest your legs

Act like you've been here before
Smile less and dress up some more
Tie up your scarf real tight
These boys are out for blood tonight

Slow it down, Angie come back to bed
Rest your arms, and rest your legs

And when she stood she stood tall
She'll make a fool of you all
Don't ask for cigarettes
She ain't got nothing left for you

I never, she never, we never looked back
That wasn't what we were good at
And when it came to love
We were not good enough on

Slow it down, Angie come back to bed
Rest your arms, and rest your legs
Don't you frown when you're feelin' like that
Only love can dig you out of this"
Donna,The Lumineers,III,"{'year': 2019, 'month': 5, 'day': 17}","
It's not the words you say, but how you say it
I saved a picture where your hair was braided
They found your wallet in the cemetery
You told your daughter she was ordinary

You hate the name Junior
Your husband loved his computers
Your mother never was one
The eldest of seven children

If you dont have it, then you'll never give it
And I don't blame you for the way you livin’
A little boy was born in February
You couldn't sober up to hold a baby

You hate the name Donna
You love to judge strangers' karma
We drove from New Jersey
The trucks always made you worry

Hold my hand now, time to
Go to bed, it's way too late

You hate the name Donna
You love to judge strangers' karma
We drove from New Jersey
The trucks always made you worry
You raised a saint, Donna
You love to judge strangers' karma
You're praying for a funeral
You sang it like Hallelujah

You sang it like Hallelujah
You sang it like Hallelujah
You sang it like Hallelujah
You sang it like Hallelujah"
Salt and the Sea,The Lumineers,III,"{'year': 2019, 'month': 9, 'day': 13}","One, two, three, four

Could it be I was the one
That you held so deep in the night?
On the back staircase
You fell to your knees with tears in your eyes

All that you suffered, all the disease
You couldn't hide it, hide it from me

All alone, scared in your room
Would you swear there's nobody home?
On the bed, laying awake
As you prayed he'd leave you alone

I'll let the darkness swallow me whole
I need to find you, need you to know

I'll be your friend in the daylight again
There we will be, like an old enemy
Like the salt and the sea

And they wrote all these prescriptions
They wrote me off like a heel
Yeah, the doctors with their medicine
Left me to rock in my filth

From the destruction, out of the flame
You need a villain, give me a name

I'll be your friend in the daylight again
There we will be, like an old enemy
I'll be your friend in the daylight again
There we will be, like an old enemy
Like the salt and the sea
Like the salt and the sea"
My Eyes,The Lumineers,Cleopatra,"{'year': 2016, 'month': 4, 'day': 8}","Oh, the devil's inside
You opened the door, you gave him a ride
Too young to know, too old to admit
That you couldn't see how it ends

What did you do to my eyes?
What did you sing to that lonely child?
Promised it all, but you lied
You better slow down, baby, soon
It's all or nothing to you

The glow of Hollywood signs
They sold you a bridge
They fed you the lines they fed you to lions)
You always confused your servants for friends
But you couldn't see how it ends
It's all or nothing to you

What did you do to my eyes?
What did you say to my only child?
Promised your love, but you lied
You better slow down, baby, soon
It's all or nothing to you

What did you do to my eyes?
What did you sing to that lonely child?
Promised it all, but you lied
You better slow down, baby, soon"
Flowers in Your Hair,The Lumineers,The Lumineers EP,"{'year': 2009, 'month': 12, 'day': 19}","When we were younger we thought
Everyone was on our side
Then we grew a little bit
And romanticized
The time I saw
Flowers in your hair

See, it takes a boy to live
It takes a man to pretend he was there

So then we grew a little
And knew a lot
And how we demonstrated
It to the cops
And all the things we said
We were selfassured

'Cause it's a long road to wisdom
But it's a short one to bein' ignored

Be in my eyes
And be in my heart
Be in my eyes, aye, aye, aye
And be in my heart

So now I think that I could
Love you back
And I hope it's not too late
'Cause you're so attractive
And the way you move
I won't close my eyes

'Cause it takes a man to live
It takes a woman to make him compromise

So be in my eyes
Be in my heart
Be in my eyes, aye, aye, aye
And be in my heart"
Leader of the Landslide,The Lumineers,III,"{'year': 2019, 'month': 8, 'day': 2}","In your old wicker chair
Singing, ooh
You were wrong, I was right
Didn't matter in a fight
Singing, ooh
Coffee mug, filled it up
Always knew what it was
Singing, ooh
Been on your side for years
You could never love without crying
Ooh
Is she dead? Is she fine?
Every day, every night
Fate has dealt me a lonely blow
I said, ooh
Tried to help, but only hurt
In the end, I made it worse
Singing, ooh
Is she dead? Is she fine?
Every day, every night
Give back my keys, give back my chair
Take back those clothes you always left on the floor
You drove me wild, drove me insane
Drank the whole bottle and forgot my name
All I ever wanted was a mother for the first time
Finally, I can see you as the leader of the landslide
She left, she left, the writing's on the wall
Please believe me, I smell the alcohol
The only thing I know is that we're in too deep
And maybe when she's dead and gone, I'll get some sleep
You blamed it all on your kids
We were young, we were innocent
You told me a lie, fuck you for that
Fuck all your pride and fuck all your prayers
And all this time, I waited like a fool, and for the first time
Finally, I can see you as the leader of the landslide
She left, she left, the writing's on the wall
Please believe me, don't answer when she calls
The only thing I know is that we're in too deep
And maybe when she's dead and gone, I'll get some sleep
Out there on my own, I was feeling so alone
Like a poltergeist in the afterlife
Fading by degrees, I was shaking in the knees
In the aftermath of this broken glass
Oh, oh, oh"
Gale Song,The Lumineers,Cleopatra,"{'year': 2013, 'month': 11, 'day': 1}","It's a lonely road, full of tired men
And you can see it in their faces
And you'll be home in spring, I can wait 'til then
I heard you're on the big train

And, oh, this too shall pass
This loneliness won't last for long

I wasn't there to take his place
I was ten thousand miles away
So when you hear my voice
When you say my name
May it never give you pain
But I don't wanna go, but it's time to leave
You'll be on my mind, my destiny

And I won't fight in vain
I'll love you just the same, oh

I couldn't know what's in your mind
But I saw the pictures, you're looking fine
And there was a time when I stood in line
For love, for love, for love
But I let you go, oh
I let you go

And he fell apart with his broken heart
And this blood, this blood, this blood
Oh, it drains from my skin, it does"

Everyone knew what the man had done
Oh, he'll take you for a ride
Jimmy believed in the American way
A prison guard, he worked hard and made the minimum wage
He found his freedom lockin’ men in a cage, oh
Jimmy loved Bonnie and he fathered a kid
A baby boy, but the mother had other reasons to live
She left the baby with a note on the bed, oh
It was a struggle just to cover the rent
His jail cut hours and now his little baby was sick
He needed money and he needed it quick
It was  AM

Oh, my love, oh, my love
Could you spare my blood, spare my blood?

Jim woke his son and buckled him in the car
They drove an hour from town and found a gambling hall
The waitress babysat the boy at the bar, oh no
After an hour, Jimmy doubled his cash
He took his kid and his winnings as the dealer just laughed
He said they leave, but then they always come back, that's a fact
Out on the road, they caught a stranger in the lights
His thumb was up and his son asked if the man was alright
Jim said you never give a hitcher a ride 'cause its us or them
It was  AM

Oh, my love, oh, my love
Could you spare my blood, spare my blood?

 years gone and now the boy is a man
Broke Jimmy's habits, got in mountains and mountains of debt
And now the sharks are coming back to collect, ohoh
They stripped his jewelry and the boots off Jim's feet
They kick him out of the car and say we'll give you a week
Eight miles from home and only  degrees
It was  AM

Oh, my love, oh, my love
Could you spare my blood, spare my blood?

Now Jimmy's son is trying to make his way home
His graveyard shift had ended and it was starting to snow
He sees an old man walking barefoot alone
It was  AM
His old man waved his hands with tears in his eyes
But Jimmy's son just sped up and remembered daddy's advice
No, you don't ever give a hitcher a ride cause its us or them
'Cause its me or him

God and medicine take no mercy on him
Poisoned his blood, and burned out his throat
Enough is enough, he's a long way from home

Days of my youth wasted on a selfish fool
Who ran for the hills from the hand you were dealt
I flew far away, as far as I could go
Your time is running out
And I'm a long way from home

Laid up in bed, you were laid up in bed
Holding the pain like you're holding your breath
I prayed you could sleep, sleep like a stone
You're right next to me
But you're a long way from home

Hospital gowns never fit like they should
We yelled at the nurse, didn't do any good
More morphine”, the last words you moaned
At last I was sure
That you weren't far away from home"

Who will give you a love so true
You can always find me where the skies are blue

Lay your dreams, little darlin', in a flower bed
Let that sunshine in your hair, in your hair

You're gonna bleed somebody's brand new love, mama
Who's gonna feel just like it always do

And when your fairytale is through
And you're looking for someone new
You can always find me where the skies are blue

And I left the footprints, the mud stained on the carpet
And it hardened like my heart did when you left town
But I must admit it, that I would marry you in an instant
Damn your wife, I'd be your mistress just to have you around

But I was late for this, late for that, late for the love of my life
And when I die alone, when I die alone, when I die I'll be on time

And the church discouraged, any lust that burned in me
Yes my flesh, it was my currency, but I held out
When a man's rejected, but he can fight for your affection
And he can act like he never met you and leave low to the ground

But I was late for this, late for that, late for the love of my life
And when I die alone, when I die alone, when I die I'll be on time

So I drive a taxi, and the traffic distracts me
From the strangers in my backseat, they remind me of you
But it's all a daydream, but it's you who's behind me
But you never recognize me, it brings me to you

And the only gifts from my Lord were a birth and a divorce
But I've read this script and the costume fits, so I'll play my part

And there are nights I wake up, to the sound of a door shut
And I search on the floors but I find no tracks
And the nurse in white shoes leads me back to my guestroom
It's a bed and a bathroom
And a place for the end

I was late for this, late for that, late for the love of my life

Pick me up and turn me round
I go numb- born with a weak heart
Guess I must be having fun
The less we say about it the better
Make it up as we go along
Feet on the ground
Head in the sky
It's alright I know nothing's wrong . . nothing wrong

Hi yo, I got plenty of time
Hi yo, you got light in your eyes
And you're standing here beside me
I love the passing of time
Never for money
Always for love
Cover up and say goodnight . . . say goodnight

Home- is where I want to be
But I guess I'm already there
I come home- she lifted up her wings
I guess that this must be the place
I can't tell one from the other
Did I find you, or you find me?
There was a time before we were born
If someone asks, this where I'll be . . . where I'll be

Hi yo, we drift in and out
Hi yo, sing into my mouth
Out of all those kinds of people
You got a face with a view
I'm just an animal looking for a home
Share the same space for a minute or two
And you love me till my heart stops
Love me till I'm dead
Eyes that light up, eyes look through you
Cover up the blank spots
Hit me on the head ah ooh"

She walks up, staircase in white
She holds her breath, pretends that this is right
'Cause all of this, it don't come free
And don't become a casualty
And live beneath what you were meant to be
'Cause cowards and heroes feel
The same as you and me, it's real
But some will run and others persevere
Victory is in the fight
And men with hearts will bleed tonight
And only rest, and rest is what is right"

Alone above the raging sea
Stole the only girl I love
And drowned her deep inside of me

Is there something I can send you from across the sea?
From the place where I'll be landing
No, there's nothing you can send me, my own true love
There's nothing I'm wishing to be owning
Just to carry yourself back to me unspoiled
From across that lonesome ocean
Well I just thought you might want something fine
Made of silver or of golden
Either from the mountains of Madrid
Or from the coast of Barcelona
And if I had the stars of the darkest night
Or the diamonds from the deepest ocean
I'd forsake them all for your sweet kiss
For that's all I'm wishing to be owning
And I might be gone a long old time
And it's only this I'm asking
Is there something I can send you to remember me by?
To make your time more easy passing
Oh how can, how can you ask me again?
What only brings me sorrow
The same thing I would want today
I would want again tomorrow
I got a letter on a lonesome day
It was from her ship asailing
Saying I don't know when I'll be coming back again
It depends on how I'm feeling
Well if you, my love, must think that way
And I'm sure your mind is roaming
And I'm sure your heart is not with me
But with the country to where you're going
So take heed, take heed of the western wind
And take heed of the stormy weather
And yes, there's something you can send back to me

See 'em fly from St. Paul
And I go running when the night aches

Did I hear something break?

And I'm his mother standing

Like a drugless addict
It's too late, the moment
When it runs you over
No one's safe, I need her
No one say it's over

Oh I was leaving for the East horizon
And Joshua was on sea of diamonds
I left my home, it was not wrong for me to leave
I could not hold all of your promises to keep

And I was on my own in a broken boat, I cried
And what I'd give to know, is it me who's on your mind?

I'm standing on your porch screamin' out
And I won't leave until you come downstairs

So keep your head up, keep your love
Keep your head up, my love
Keep your head up, my love
Keep your head up, keep your love

And I don't blame you, dear
For running like you did all these years
I would do the same, you best believe
And the highway signs say we're close
But I don't read those things anymore
I never trusted my own eyes

When we were young, oh oh we did enough
When it got cold, ooh ooh we bundled up
I can't be told, ah ah it can't be done

Angela (Live),The Lumineers,Song Seeds - EP,"{'year': 2017, 'month': 4, 'day': 22}","When you left this town, with your windows down
And the wilderness inside
Let the exits pass, all the tar and glass
'Til the road and sky align

The strangers in this town
They raise you up just to cut you down
Oh, Angela, it's a long time coming

And your Volvo lights lit up green and white
With the cities on the signs
But you held your course to some distant war
In the corners of your mind

From the second time around
The only love I ever found
Oh Angela it's a long time coming

Home at last

Were you safe and warm in your coat of arms
With your fingers in a fist
Did you hear the notes, all those static codes
In the radio abyss?

Strangers in this town
They raise you up just to cut you down
Oh Angela it's a long time coming
Oh Angela spent your whole life running away

Home at last
Home at last

Vacancy, hotel room, lost in me, lost in you
Angela, on my knee, I belong, I believe

Home at last
Home at last
Home at last
Home at last

Home at last

Long Way From Home Seed,The Lumineers,Song Seeds - EP,"{'year': 2017, 'month': 4, 'day': 22}","Held on to hope like a noose, like a rope
God and medicine take no mercy on him
Poisoned his blood, and burned out his throat
Enough is enough, he's a long way from home

Days of my youth wasted on a selfish fool
Who ran for the hills from the hand you were dealt
I flew far away, as far as I could go
Your time is running out
And I'm a long way from home

Laid up in bed, you were laid up in bed
Holding the pain like you're holding your breath
I prayed you could sleep, sleep like a stone
You're right next to me
But you're a long way from home

Hospital gowns nevеr fit like they should
We yеlled at the nurse, didn't do any good
More morphine, the last words you moaned
At last I was sure
That you weren't far away from home"

I, I should've known better
And I can't feel no remorse
And you don't feel nothing back

I, I got a new girlfriend here
Feels like he's on top
And I don't feel no remorse
And you can't see past my blindness

Oh, Ophelia
You've been on my mind, girl, since the flood
Oh, Ophelia
Heaven help the fool who falls in love

I, I got a little paycheck
You got big plans and you gotta move Whoo!)
And I don't feel nothing at all
And you can't feel nothing small

Honey, I love you
That's all she wrote

Oh, Ophelia
You've been on my mind, girl, like a drug
Oh, Ophelia
Heaven help the fool who falls in love
Oh, Ophеlia
You've been on my mind, girl, since the flood

I saved a picture where your hair was braided
They found your wallet in the cemetery
You told your daughter she was ordinary

You hate the name Junior
Your husband loved his computers
Your mother never was one
The eldest of seven children

If you don't have it, then you'll never give it
And I don't blame you for the way you livin'
The little boy was born in February
You couldn't sober up to hold a baby

You hate the name Donna
You love to judge strangers' karma
We drove from New Jersey
The trucks always made you worry

Hold my hand now, time to
Go to bed, it's way too late

You hate the name Donna
You love to judge strangers' karma
We drove from New Jersey
The trucks always made you worry
We raised a saint daughter
You love to judge strangers' karma
You're praying for a funeral
You sang it like Hallelujah

You sang it like Hallelujah
You sang it like Hallelujah
You sang it like Hallelujah
You sang it like Hallelujah"

Gloria, booze and peppermint
Gloria, no one said enough is enough
Gloria, they found you on the floor
Gloria, my hand was tied to yours
And, Gloria, did you finally see that enough is enough?

Did you know me when I was younger then?
I could take the whole world with me
I would find myself feelin' alone
Heaven, help me now, Heaven, show the way
Get me back on my own two feet
I would lie awake and pray you don't lie awake for me

Ohohohoh
Ohohohoh
Ohohohohoh

Gloria, you crawled up on your cross
Gloria, you made us sit and watch
Gloria, no one said enough is enough

Heaven, help me now Heaven, help)
Heaven, show the way Heaven, show)
Get me back on my own two feet
I would lie awake and pray you don't lie awake for me
