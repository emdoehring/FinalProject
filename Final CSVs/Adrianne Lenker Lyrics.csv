​anything,Adrianne Lenker,songs,"{'year': 2020, 'month': 9, 'day': 2}","Staring down the barrel of the hot sun
Shining with the sheen of a shotgun Shotgun)
Carol has a little if we need some
Joa has a ride if we wanna come
Hanging your jeans with a clothespin
Skin still wet, still on my skin
Mango in your mouth, juice drippin'
Shoulder of your shirt sleeve slippin'

Christmas Eve with your mother and sis
Don't wanna fight but your mother insists
Dog's white teeth slice right through my fist
Drive to the ER and they put me on risk
Grocery store list, now you get pissed
Unchecked calls and messages
I don't wanna be the owner of your fantasy
I just wanna be a part of your family

And I don't wanna talk about anything
I don't wanna talk about anything
I wanna kiss, kiss your eyes again
Wanna witness your eyes looking
I don't wanna talk about anyonе
I don't wanna talk about anyone
I wanna sleep in your car while you're driving
Lay in your lap whеn I'm crying
 
Circle of pine and red oak
Circle of moss and fire smoke
Fan on the ceiling like a wheel spoke
Push the clutch and I pull the choke
Wanna listen to the sound of you blinking
Wanna listen to your hands soothe
Listen to your heart beating
Listen to the way you move

And I don't wanna talk about anything
I don't wanna talk about anything
I wanna kiss, kiss your eyes again
Wanna witness your eyes looking
I don't wanna talk about anyone
I don't wanna talk about anyone
I wanna sleep in your car while you're driving
Lay in your lap when I'm crying

Weren't we the stars in Heaven?
Weren't we the salt in the sea?
Dragon in the new warm mountain
Didn't you believe in me?
You held me the whole way through
But I couldn't say the words like you
I was scared, Indigo, but I wanted to
I was scared, Indigo, but I wanted to
And I don't wanna talk about anything
I don't wanna talk about anything
I wanna kiss, kiss your eyes again
Wanna witness your eyes looking
I don't wanna talk about anyone
I don't wanna talk about anyone
I wanna sleep in your car while you're driving
Lay in your lap when I'm crying"
"​not a lot, just forever",Adrianne Lenker,songs,"{'year': 2020, 'month': 10, 'day': 23}","Through your eyes I see
A smile you bring to me
To your joy I tether

Not a lot, just forever
Intertwined sewn together
Like the rock bears the weather
Not a lot, just forever

My dog barks wildly
To protect my infancy
From my exbeliever
And I try to calm the wolf
To remind her I am both
Still she tears at my sweater

Not a lot, just forever
Intertwined, sewn together
As the wren sheds her feather
Not a lot, just forever

And your dearest fantasy
Is to grow a baby in me
I could be a good mother
And I wanna be your wife
So I hold you to my knife
And I steal your letter
 
Not a lot, just forever
Intertwine some together
As the rock bears the weather
Not a lot, just forever

So I bash around the house
And the poison stains my mouth
She comes, I let her
And we share a paradise
And I roll them once or twice
Can't get much better

Not a lot, just forever
Intertwined sewn together
As the rock bears the weather
Not a lot, just forever
Not a lot, just forever
Intertwined, sewn together
As the wren bares her feathers
Not a lot, just forever"
​ingydar,Adrianne Lenker,songs,"{'year': 2020, 'month': 10, 'day': 23}","Fragilely, gradually and surrounding
The horse lies naked in the shed
Evergreen anodyne decompounding
Flies draw sugar from his head

His eyes are blueberries, video screens, Minneapolis schemes
And the dried flowers from books halfread
The juice of dark cherries cover his chin
The dog walks in and the crow lies in his jaw like lead

Everything eats and is eaten
Time is fed

Early еvening, the pink ring swallows
The sphеrical marigold terrain
Sleepily, Venus sinks and hollows
The stationed headlight of a plane

You are as far from me as memory
With fixtures fracture varyingly
The juice of dark cherries cover my skin
Six years in, no baby
 
Everything eats and is eaten

Ingydar bares a scar like a meteor
Crystalline amber guilds her cheek
Tambourine of the beech leaves lead her
To the raven playing hide and seek

Drying blueberries, figurines
And the angel leans at the head of the bed
The juice of dark cherries cover her chin
The dog walks in and the crow lies in his smile like lead

Everything eats and is eaten, time is fed
Everything eats and is eaten
Everything eats and is eaten
Everything eats and is eaten
Everything eats and is eaten
Everything eats and is eaten"
Sadness As a Gift,Adrianne Lenker,Bright Future,"{'year': 2024, 'month': 1, 'day': 17}","Two
And one, two, three, four

You and I both know
There is nothing more to say
Chance has shut her shining eyes
And turned her face away

Leaning on the windowsill
You could write me someday, and I think you will
We could see the sadness as a gift and still
Feel too heavy to hold

Snow fallin'
I try to keep from callin'
Watch the spring turn to winter
Fireflies all frozen

The seasons go so fast
Thinking that this one was gonna last
Maybe the question was too much to ask
 
Been searching for your eyes
All I see is blue skies
And that old man beats his crooked cane
It's time to let go

Leaning on the windowsill
You could write me someday, and I bet you will
We could see the sadness as a gift and still
The seasons go so fast
Thinking that this one was gonna last
Maybe the question was too much to ask

You and I could see into the same eternity
Every second brimming with a majesty

Oh, kiss so sweet, so fine
You could hear the music inside my mind
And you showed me a place
I'll find even when I'm old
Just leaning on the windowsill
You could write me someday, and I hope you will
We could see the sadness as a gift and still
The seasons go so fast
Thinking that this one was gonna last
Maybe the question was too much to ask"
​zombie girl,Adrianne Lenker,songs,"{'year': 2020, 'month': 10, 'day': 23}","What a dream that was
I almost couldn't wake because
I was frozen in bed with a zombie girl
Vacant as a closed down fair

Sleep paralysis, I sworn I couldve felt you there
And I almost could've kissed your hair
But the emptiness withdrew me
From any kind of wishful prayer

Oh, emptiness
Tell me 'bout your nature
Maybe Ive been getting you wrong
I cover you with questions
Cover you with explanations
Cover you with music

Then the next night
Dreaming I could feel your skin
But the dream escaped so easily
And I wokе up to the road again
 
How your words ring through
Something kinda sweet and blue
And I knеw that you'd been understanding
Everything that I'd said, too

About emptiness
Tell me 'bout your nature
Maybe I've been getting you wrong
I cover you with questions
Cover you with explanations
Cover you with music

What's on your mind?
What's on your mind?
What's on your mind?
Whats on your mind?
In your mind"

To let you leave
Tell me lies
I wanna see your eyes
Is it a crime to say
I still need you?
Crime, wanna feed you

Light blue, dark blue, grey
Crimson trail
Straight through, stay don't stray

Grandmother, Juniper
Tell to me your recipe
Is it a cry I hear
From the deep wood?
Crying, reappear from
The weeds

Light blue, dark blue, grey
Crimson trail
Straight through, stay don't stray
 
Through the jail
See the sun
Flat as a knife
Cold and white
To my home, two rivers
Through my home, two reverse
Is it a crime to do
What you ask me to?

Real House,Adrianne Lenker,Bright Future,"{'year': 2024, 'month': 3, 'day': 22}","Do you remember running?
The purity of the air around
Braiding willow branches into a crown
That love is all I want

I'm a child humming
Into the clarity of black space
Where stars shine like tears on the night's face
With a cool wind

Mama, what happened?
I never thought we'd go this long
Now, thirtyone and I don't feel strong
And your love is all I want

When I was seven
I saw the first film that made me scared
And I thought of this whole world ending
I thought of dying unprepared

We moved into a real house
A wild field behind it
I wanted to be an inventor
Collected scraps to make a portal
I wanted so much for magic to be real
 
So many dreams of flying
Rising high over the crowd
And they'd go, Oh, man, look at her go!""
And I'd go

Do you remember
Coming to the hospital when I was fourteen?
My friends all left me there spinning
Dad was angry, but you saw everything
And you made me laugh as the nurses undressed me
You held my hand as they put the needle in me

I never saw you cry
Not until our dog died
And the whole family came back together
We held her body as they put the needle in her
And then I saw you cry
And then I saw you cry"

Shadows of the words I've said
I don't wanna blame you, I don't wanna blame
The stars bloom in the warm summer night
They have a clear view without the bedroom light
They don't wanna name you, they don't wanna name
Dragons have silent eyes
Cracked eggshells, fireflies
I don't wanna tame you, I don't wanna tame
When the hot sand burns my feet
You have cool hands, you are sweet
I don't wanna changе you, I don't wanna change
Carnations into the vase
Unfold your clothеs out of the case
I just want a place with you, I just want a place
As the coastline is shaped by the wind
As we make love and you're on my skin
You are changing me, you are changing
Stars bloom on a warm summer night
They have a clear view without the bedroom light
I just want a place with you, I just want a place $"

Thinking, I'm not afraid of you now

Letting my eyes close
Shedding my soft clothes
Wind blows
Wind that howls like a hound
Wind that laughs like a clown

Mystery of lack
Stabbing stars through my back
Forwards, beckon, rebound
Forwards, beckon, rebound

Virtual bedroom
Rise like a full moon
Show me pictures that hang in your house
Pictures that hang in your mouth
Candescent insects
Crosses and fishnecks
I have nothing to pray to you now
Nothing to pray to you now
 
Mystery of lack
Stabbing stars through my back

Pulling your face close, wanting the inmost
Show me

Both arms cradle you now

Stabbing stars through my back

Free Treasure,Adrianne Lenker,Bright Future,"{'year': 2024, 'month': 3, 'day': 18}","Do you wanna go to the river?
I know this spot so deep and green
With wild raspberries and apple trees
And rocks to climb between
Water like a washing machine

Do you wanna dance?
Sometimes I think I try too hard
I trip on my shoes and I trip on my shirt
Get caught on the dirt in the yard
Caught on the dirt in the yard

You show me
Understanding
Patience and pleasure
Time and attention
Love without measure
Love without measure

You're cooking dinner
It's gettin' around halfpastten
I haven't smelled food so good
Since I don't know where and I don't know whеn
Where and I don't know—
 
Stove light glows likе a fire
We're sitting on the kitchen floor
Just when I thought I couldn't feel more
I feel a little more
I feel a little—

Understanding
Patience and pleasure
Time and attention
Love without measure
Love without measure

There's a guy at the nape of my neck
And he hangs out there all day
He quantifies my every thought
And tells me not to play
He tells me not to play

We lay around for hours
Talk about childhood pain
Mom and dad and past lives too
I can tell you anything
I can say anything
You show me
Understanding
Patience and pleasure
Time and attention
Love without measure
Love without measure
Show me
Understanding
Patience and pleasure
The eleventh dimension
Free treasure
Free treasure
Free treasure"

 bridge, hometown
Half return, half return

Standing in the yard, dressed like a kid
The house is white and the lawn is dead
The lawn is dead, the lawn is dead

Illinois toll road, Indiana plain
Roll the windows down, shoot at the change
Half return, half return
Honey in your mouth when you gave me my name
Tears in your eyes when you pull it likе a chain
Half return, half return

Standing in the yard, drеssed like a kid
The house is white and the lawn is dead
The lawn is dead, the lawn is dead
 

Half return, half return
Rusty swing set, plastic slide
Push me up and down, take me for a ride

The house is white and the lawn is dead
The lawn is dead, the lawn is dead"

Open my hands that catch your wall
Nothing to hear but my very own cry
Far below the rocks and sky

My angel, my angel
My angel, my angel

Strange as she appears to be
Oldest friend invisibly
She brushes my hair with a physical hand
Lowers my body down to the land

My angel, my angel
My angel, my angel

Beneath the ledge in the morning mist
She kisses my eyelids and my wrists
Wake to the bleeding of the blade of thе sun
Returning to my oxygen
 
My angel, my angеl
My angel, my angel

Take me into the shore
I'm not cold, I'm not cold
Take my hand, take a hold

Let me lie on your arms
I'm weightless in the sea
Up to my ears the salt sits
In a circle around me

Take my life into your life
Take a branch with your knife

I guess I am human, but sometimes I feel
Like I'm only a ghost, like I'm only a wall
And if you come around, honey
I'll probably just follow you home
'Cause it's all that I know how to do
I was born by a body, I'll die by one too
And places are nothing if they ain't got you

And one day I'mma be a steamboat baby
One day I can be your freight train lady
I roll down the river and the miles won't phase me
Oh, I wish I was better at being alone
Still every night, I call you on the phone
Oh, I wish I was more than my skin and my bone

Well, I've been arranging each of my movements
And all of my gestures and trying to fool myself
Into thinking that everything's small
That nothing has reason, I woke up and cried
A convulsion of honesty brought me to life
When I thought I was gone
But I can't put a lie in the mouth of a song
 
And one day I'mma be a steamboat baby

'Cause I'd rather be lonely
And cold and awake
Than asleep in a warm and a comfortable place
 And oh, oh, where do I go from here?
Please direct the melody in my ear

Miles and miles away into a place
My heart was scheming an escape that love drew from me
And I met you on the corner of the seasons
Out of winter's reach and into summer's early sun
You were the moon and I was only seventeen

And now I'm making all these things
And constructing all these scenes
And I'm stitching at the seams
Of the fabric of my dreams
And I'm here in my boat
And I'm rowing up to shore as you sing

Well I'm ringing all the bells from my lighthouse, dear
Time is just an ocean and you're almost here
One for the mind, two for the soul
Three for the body and the heart that knows
That knows I'll never ever let you go

Oh silence, the silence aringing your bells
Singing the words in a whisper
Dispel all this noise, bring back the joy
Ring the world awake
'Cause if the only whole that we have is a world apart
And it's separate and broken and stained from the start
My heart will remain and take it anyway

To the robin's beak?

I know that you were right I couldn't let you in
But I held you so tight your breath burned on my skin
And is it near or is it far that we begin?
To know something's near
Not the change in the seasons that scares me, dear
It's the sound in the distance that I start to hear
Some days in my mind, I see you look the same
The way you were two years ago when you came
I see you there softly moving sweet around my pain
Fixing my heart and my hands and my brain
But we knew we couldn't stay, we couldn't stay
And you know something's near
Not the change in the seasons that scares me, dear
It's the sound in the distance I start to hear
When it rolls in just like thunder
When the storm, it breaks
Makes me wonder why you came at all
And you're gone, gone, gone, gone
And when you leave part of you will
Part of me will start to breathe
When you're gone, gone, gone, gone
 Some days I'll admit I don't know what to do
You came in, you gave me the deepest parts of you
But now I'm falling asleep and I'm falling awake
And I don't know now how long it's gonna take

It can always read my mind

A hard rain hurricane and you
In the center of the flood

Azure blue

In a strange kitchen
Dragonfly twitching
Breathing in the air conditioning
Feeling cold and free

You know I'm homesick for you
No matter the place, no matter the view
Cities and parties
Where dreams come true

Fire ants so agile
Through the sweating trash pile
Lifting one hundred times their body weights
Carry it back to the kids

Cupboards filled with empty space
Withered flowers in a vase
Pimples on a pretty face

Grass that's gone to seed
And bracelets with broken beads
Gardens filled with weeds
And books that no one reads

The imperfection of this life
It's what makes us perfectly alright
Without your every little flaw
You wouldn't mean anything to me at all

Broken promise to a friend
Nothing in your heart to lend
Stubborn so you never bend
Fearful so you just pretend

Smile with crooked teeth
Song with broken beat
Sun with burning heat
And secrets that no one keeps

I will sing its song with you

At first I thought you were so cool
Gave my heart and let you rule, what a damn fool
You told me things you never meant
I thought that you were heavensent, you made a dent
But then you turned it off and told me we were through

Why can't you show it to me?
Seems so hard to recognize what is truth and what are lies
When you lead me on

With lowrise jeans and highrise thong would turn you on
How could you carelessly just turn away from me?
