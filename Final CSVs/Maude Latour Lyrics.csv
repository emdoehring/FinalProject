One More Weekend,"I fell in love with how you emphasize your sentences
And I got a crush on the shape of your name on my phone
Then I fell harder for your fifties movies references
And the world is smaller with you, maybe I'm not so alone
Or maybe we're alone together
Now you're packing up your bedroom on the west-side
So, I bring you breakfast and we lie on the floor of my apartment
Isn't it alarmin', it was October, January, almost July
Here's a toast to getting older, now we're young and soon we'll die

Nothing lasts forever
One more weekend in the city
Break up through the summer, leave me all on my own
One more weekend can you kiss me?
Tell me that you miss me even if you won’t

I guess my memories get better with the distance
So, I made a list of all the reasons why I felt conflicted
You were teaching me to drive your parents' car around your high school parking lot
Michigan seems like a dream, but I woke up and I forgot

Nothing lasts forever
One more weekend in the city
Break up through the summer, leave me all on my own
One more weekend can you kiss me?
Tell me that you miss me even if you won’t

(I-I wa-want you) 'Cause I know you won't
(I-I wa-want you) 'Cause I know you won't
(I-I wa-want you) 'Cause I know you won't

Maybe I've been lying to myself since last October
'Cause I saw you 'cross the campus and I wished it wasn't over
And I know you're late to class, but can I take back every single thing I said?
If we just had one more weekend, could we try it all again?

And nothing lasts forever
One more weekend in the city
Break up through the summer, leave me all on my own
One more weekend can you kiss me?
Tell me that you miss me even if you won’t

(I-I wa-want you) 'Cause I know you won't
(I-I wa-want you) 'Cause I know you won't
(I-I wa-want you) 'Cause I know you won't","{'I': 20, 'fell': 2, 'in': 4, 'love': 1, 'with': 3, 'how': 1, 'you': 18, 'emphasize': 1, 'your': 6, 'sentences': 1, 'And': 4, 'got': 1, 'a': 4, 'crush': 1, 'on': 7, 'the': 13, 'shape': 1, 'of': 3, 'name': 1, 'my': 6, 'phone': 1, 'Then': 1, 'harder': 1, 'for': 1, 'fifties': 1, 'movies': 1, 'references': 1, 'world': 1, 'is': 1, 'smaller': 1, 'you,': 1, 'maybe': 2, ""I'm"": 1, 'not': 1, 'so': 1, 'alone': 2, 'Or': 1, ""we're"": 2, 'together': 1, 'Now': 1, ""you're"": 2, 'packing': 1, 'up': 5, 'bedroom': 1, 'west-side': 1, 'So,': 2, 'bring': 1, 'breakfast': 1, 'and': 4, 'we': 3, 'lie': 1, 'floor': 1, 'apartment': 1, ""Isn't"": 1, 'it': 4, ""alarmin',"": 1, 'was': 1, 'October,': 1, 'January,': 1, 'almost': 1, 'July': 1, ""Here's"": 1, 'toast': 1, 'to': 4, 'getting': 1, 'older,': 1, 'now': 1, 'young': 1, 'soon': 1, ""we'll"": 1, 'die': 1, 'Nothing': 2, 'lasts': 3, 'forever': 3, 'One': 6, 'more': 7, 'weekend': 6, 'city': 3, 'Break': 3, 'through': 3, 'summer,': 3, 'leave': 3, 'me': 10, 'all': 5, 'own': 3, 'can': 4, 'kiss': 3, 'me?': 3, 'Tell': 3, 'that': 3, 'miss': 3, 'even': 3, 'if': 3, 'won’t': 3, 'guess': 1, 'memories': 1, 'get': 1, 'better': 1, 'distance': 1, 'made': 1, 'list': 1, 'reasons': 1, 'why': 1, 'felt': 1, 'conflicted': 1, 'You': 2, 'were': 1, 'teaching': 1, 'drive': 1, ""parents'"": 1, 'car': 1, 'around': 1, 'high': 1, 'school': 1, 'parking': 1, 'lot': 1, 'Michigan': 1, 'seems': 1, 'like': 2, 'dream,': 1, 'but': 2, 'woke': 1, 'forgot': 1, 'might': 1, 'also': 1, '(I-I': 6, 'wa-want': 6, 'you)': 6, ""'Cause"": 7, 'know': 7, ""won't"": 6, 'Maybe': 1, ""I've"": 1, 'been': 1, 'lying': 1, 'myself': 1, 'since': 1, 'last': 1, 'October': 1, 'saw': 1, ""'cross"": 1, 'campus': 1, 'wished': 1, ""wasn't"": 1, 'over': 1, 'late': 1, 'class,': 1, 'take': 1, 'back': 1, 'every': 1, 'single': 1, 'thing': 1, 'said?': 1, 'If': 1, 'just': 1, 'had': 1, 'one': 1, 'weekend,': 1, 'could': 1, 'try': 1, 'again?': 1, 'nothing': 1}"
Shoot and Run,"You look so good, I think you're the one
I can't help but stare lately
You're pulling me in, you're everything I want
Damn, it's so unfair baby
I'll give you it all, but it's not enough
Love just really scares me
And they say that I'ma fuck it up
But, you don't really care, maybe

But baby, you know that I just misbehave
I'm not the type who can sit down and stay
I don't deserve you as much as I want to
So bad, so bad

But if you wanna go
I'll be your best mistake
All's fair in love and war
That's just how we play
And baby I don't keep my promises
I just shoot and run
You know it from the start
I'll only break your heart
I'll break your heart

And we go, wind in my hair
Driving through the light
The way you move and everything you do
Makes me wanna stay the night
But, I know you too well and I'ma make you bleed
I can never do you right
And I don't wanna see you cry
And I'm the reason why

But baby, you know that I just misbehave
I'm not the type who can sit down and stay
I don't deserve you as much as I want to
So bad, so bad

But if you wanna go
I'll be your best mistake
All's fair in love and war
That's just how we play
And baby I don't keep my promises
I just shoot and run
You know it from the start
I'll only break your heart
I'll break your heart
And I think I love you but babe I don't want to
I'm only gonna mess around
And you make it worth it but I don't deserve it
I'm only gonna let you down

But if you wanna go
I'll be your best mistake
All's fair in love and war
That's just how we play
And baby I don't keep my promises
I just shoot and run
You know it from the start
I'll only break your heart
I'll break your heart

Walk Backwards,"I guess I'll never understand
The line between our love and romance
'Cause when I look at you I
Fall right into a dream
Under galaxies in the middle of the city in New York
So, I say thanks to an unknown force

Me and my friends do whatever we want
And by friends I really only mean one in particular
And that's you

Mmm, your hair's untied
And it's only just about a quarter to nine
You live east, so I walk backwards
Sun's slippin' south on the west-side
And we still got the rest of the night
You live east, so I walk backwards babe

I know your boyfriend's mad
Watch you grabbin' my hand all day
So, I just play it cool
'Cause, I can't believe I found you
Within the Milky Way out of all eight billion people
So, I say thanks to an unknown force

Me and my friends do whatever we want
And by friends I really only mean one in particular
(And) And that's you (It's you)

Mmm, your hair's untied
And it's only just about a quarter to nine

Furniture,"I'm probably gonna get hurt this weekend

I hate all your friends and I miss you so much

Block Your Number,"It's always best at the beginning

I remember when we first fell in love
Symphonies at the bus stop on a Tuesday
I was wearing blue Nike high tops
You were annotating Greek tragedies
I spent the next eight months
Documentin' my heart in voice memos
Tryna write down my feelings in real time
Part of me knew it would slip through my fingers so quickly
Like it always does

I guess I was too much for you
Or was I just not enough for you?
I can never decide, so I analyze
Replay all the scenes in my movie screen
How I pulled away and you made me pay
That weekend in May, that night in July
Blame it on summer, blame it on distance
Blame it on me, on all my resistance
To gettin' so close, I might really need you
You're the one person who might really see through
All of my bullshit and all of my anger
That time when you called and I didn't answer
So I just relive miscommunications
And then I go back to our last conversation

Now you're leaning against a brick wall
With your backpack on, baby
You look so much older than
Than when I met you
I can't believe it's over
I watch our lives untangle
I guess that this is the part when
I block your number

Sorting through the nuances of conversation
Your inflection tells me if you mean it
Modern love is so damn romantic
The irony of poor connection as we talk over FaceTime
What a metaphor
You say I remind you of fiction
A remarkable girl but also a nightmare
You found it poetic and sometimes magnetic
Until you got sick of my psychoanalysis
Like they always do

I'll blame it on summer, I'll blame it on distance
I'll blame it on you, on all your persistence
That it's only chances, and it's only timin'
And if it were perfect, I wouldn't be cryin'
On the floor of my dorm room, you wait in the lobby
And you keep insistin' and I keep on sobbin'
So I just relive the deliberations
And then I go back to our last conversation
Now you're leaning against a brick wall

Ride My Bike,"My mind's on fire, so I'll ride my bike
I'm riding harder than a hurricane
Love is complicated, that's alright
Swear I saw the old you for a second there

My mother made me promise home for dinner before dark
But a God I can't explain says ""Take a right at Central Park""
To clear my mind

And get that runner's high
And baby, for the very first time I'm not afraid to die
And get that runner's high, high
And babe, I think I found what it means to be alive

My mind's on fire, I feel the blood rush to my brain
Summer's only ending if you let it, babe (Don't let it)

My mother made me promise home for dinner before dark
But a God I can't explain says ""Take a right at Central Park""
To clear my mind

And get that runner's high
And baby, for the very first time I'm not afraid to die
And get that runner's high, high
And babe, I think I found what it means to be alive

So, I backpack through the universe
And I came back with no possessions
Of heartbreak and life's fake
And all the gods gave me one message
That you live fast and you die quicker
And nothing's ever gonna make you sicker
Than late nights and drunk fights
And I'm done dating bad guys
I'm starsick from last night
And this feeling's why I stay alive
I love you, let's not fight
I love you and this runner's high, runner's high

Carvin' our initials, makin' it official
Dinner with your parents
Don't you think it's sweet that I'm dreamin' 'bout you
Even when you're sleepin' next to me

And even though we've been talking two weeks
I wanna taste summer on your tongue, so sweet

Talking 'til it's alright
Whisper 'til you stop cryin'
No, I'm not afraid
I know how to be alone
Miss you like a hurricane, spinning cyclone
Tell you life is so long
Even if I'm dead wrong
Love you 'til I'm all gone

I'll always see you like at fifteen
Dancing, not afraid of anything
It kills me, fighting
Forgive you for everything (Everything, everything)
I'm sorry for everything
I'm sorry for everything
Heat wave summer
I don't want to feel cold
Miss you like a hurricane, spinning cyclone
We would stay up all night
Talking 'til it's alright
Whisper 'til you stop cryin'
No, I'm not afraid
I know how to be alone
Miss you like a hurricane, spinning cyclone
Tell you life is so long
Even if I'm dead wrong
Love you 'til I'm all gone

Strangers Forever,"Good thing you wanna be over forever
I almost knocked on your door last night
To tell you that I wanted you to be mine
And I regret leavin’
Now you write me the perfect text
You edit carefully before you press send
Suddenly, I realize that this is the end
And it kills me completely

Thank God that my phone just died
'Cause I wanted to call so you could hear me cry
I'm all alone and for the very first time
Thеre's nothing I can say to make you change your mind

I lovе you but you wanna be somebody else's baby
You love me but you’re over it and you start to hate me
So after everything we've been through together
(Would it have been better stayin') strangers forever?

Now I'm stuck on a living room floor
I feel like my body doesn't work anymore
Got so much to do but I don't know what for
I slip into memories

Flashback to a summer night
Got your Converse wet from the rain outside
And I still thought for the rest of our lives
We would have each other
God, I miss you more than ever
But there's nothing I can say to make you change your mind

I love you but you wanna be somebody else's baby
You love me but you’re over it and you start to hate me
So after everything we've been through together
(Would it have been better stayin') strangers forever?

If I knew it would end like this
Would I take back that stairway kiss?
When did you become a stranger?
You're the one who said forever

I love you but you wanna be somebody else's baby
You love me but you’re over it and you start to hate me

Got a way with your words, I don't care if it hurts
I fell for the way that it sounds
I'm in love with the dark, you're the king of my heart
Made it here and I don't care how

Numbers are too high and so am I
I'll just get wasted on them instead
They make the room dizzy and they put me to bed

You play me so great
Love's a drinking game, so let's drink what we got
You don't need a clean slate
Just say what you say and you got me locked
But, I worship your voice with your smile so coy
Pull me up and I won't look down
I love all your lies I couldn't take a goodbye
I need the dark if I wanna shine bright

So, I stop counting all of your lies
Numbers are too high and so am I
I'll just get wasted on them instead
They make the room dizzy and they put me to bed

So, you can lie and that's alright
I only need you near me and I'll be fine
I've got to say thank you, babe
For taking me to the other side

Too slow

Everybody has so much to say about the party they don't go to
Someone pulled the fire alarm, evacuate the whole school
They're all blaming me, I've got an alibi of pure gold
I was with the teacher, doing just what I was told

All the girls are getting in my car
Do their makeup on the highway
Rolling 'til they candy flip
Reversin' out the driveway
Started rumours Monday
Talk about us in the homeroom
Hurry up Samantha, getting gas
We gotta go soon

But I guеss you'll never know

So I took a shot from the fountain of youth
But babe, if you're not drinking with me
I'll have nothing to do, okay
'Cause me and my friends are meeting up under the bleachers
Where the band kids kiss the football team and I keep kissing cheerleaders

I spent the whole night staring at your face
Why don't you think you can stay?
Across the apartment I look your way
I just wanna know did she take my place?
Guess you never mean what you say

And it's hard not to come down from space
Hitting the clouds, drinking your waves
And I think of you everyday
Deep in my sleep, whisper your name

Every night I go to space
Just so I could forget you baby
There's so much I didn't say
Like I don't wanna forget you baby
If it was really love
We would've walked you to the sun
And you wouldn't give a fuck about anyone but us
But you do
You do
You do

I heard you moved south and your address changed
Can't get the phone 'cause you're boarding a plane
Why are you miles away
Short skirts lay to your hotel
I watch you go wild for someone else
Babe, don't you think I could tell

And it's hard not to come down from space
Hitting the clouds, drinking your waves
And I think of you everyday
Deep in my sleep, whisper your name

Every night I go to space

I save a little place for you if you need it

Come Back Down To Earth (Snippet),"I've built a room in my head
I guess that none of it's real
But it feels so real
I've gotten older so fast
I thought I had more time
I'm so obsessed with the past
Makes me lay down and cry
I go back to that day
You were wearing sweatpants
We were talking by the elevator
We were kids sitting on my skateboard
And you kissed me in the staircase
Made me promise we'd go back to being friends
If it all blew up
And then it all blew up
Sweet like sugar cubes
I'm kinda still in love with you
You told me not to think about it
So I thought I'd sing about it
I'm crushed, once again
I wish you were in my head
But you're not, so instead
I come back down to earth
Sometimes when I'm staring at the ceiling
I leave my body for a second, get this feeling
For a minute I'm obsessed with the darkness

City always seems like heaven 'cause the lights are always so bright
At least you think I'm pretty when I say that I lost my mind
Only live in night, I never wanna see straight
Mascara on my eyes, signing off my new fate
I don't even mind, I know that this is just a game
Living for the night, living for this new fame

The city holdin' me
Staying out till three

Go out every night and just have fun

And baby it's okay as long as I'm number one

Everyone keeps going out, our names are on the A list
Never buy a glass 'cause we're paying with our red lips
Saying fake goodbyes to people that we won't miss
Take your final bow before you pull your last kiss

We're deep into the dark
Do it for the art

You say that you wanna live fast, die young
Go out every night and just have fun
It's the price we pay to shine like diamonds
And baby it's okay as long as I'm number one

Knowing on the other line

Come Through,"You say ""Can I kiss you, without it meaning anything?"" No you can't
How could you say that, even after everything? I’m so sad
I pass your apartment and I can't help but cryin' so I walk fast
Now that the sidewalk is love and only timing, now I’m late to class

I can't stay mad at you
I can't stay mad
But, I'm so mad at you
I can't stay mad

So baby, they say that first love is the one you loose
But if you need me baby, you know I'll come through
You know I'll come through, you know I'll come through

I slip into memories, you wave across the hallway, oh what a dream you are to me now
How it wasn’t the beginnin’, to catch myself from sinking, I drown you out
Suddenly I'm replaying important conversations they seem so simple somehow
I wanna fight with you forever, miscommunications but it’s too heartbreaking

I can't stay mad at you
I can't stay mad
But, I'm so mad at you
I can’t stay mad

So baby, they say that first lovе is the one you loose
But if you need mе baby you know I'll come through
When we're so much older and I'm lonely too
If you need me baby you know I'll come through
