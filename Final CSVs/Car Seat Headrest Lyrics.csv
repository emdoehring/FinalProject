Beach Life-in-Death [2018],Car Seat Headrest,Twin Fantasy (Face to Face),"{'year': 2017, 'month': 12, 'day': 13}","Last- Last night I drove to Harper's Ferry and I thought about you
There were signs on the road that warned me of stop signs
The speed limit kept decreasing by ten
As we entered a town about halfway there
It was almost raining at the train station
We put our hoods on our heads at the train station
We threw rocks into the river
The river underneath the train tracks
And when the train came it was so big and powerful
When it came into the little station
I wanted to put my arms around it
But the conductor looked at me funny
So we had to say goodbye and leave
The Monopoly board still in the backseat
Took that nightmare left turn to get out of town
Ran into the decreasing speed limits again
What should I do? Eat breakfast)
What should I do? Eat lunch)
What should I do? Eat dinner)
What should I do? Go to bed)
Where can I go? Go to the store)
Where can I go? Apply for jobs)
Where can I go? Go to a friend's)
Where can I go? Go to bed)
I wrote Beach Death"" when I thought you were taken
I wrote Beach Funeral"" when I knew you were taken
I wrote Beach Fagz""well it wasn't about you
But it could've beenwell, no, it couldn't have
I spent a week in Ocean City
And came back to find you were gone
I spent a week in Illinois
And came back to find you were still gone
I pretended I was drunk when I came out to my friends
I never came out to my friends
We were all on Skype
And I laughed and I changed the subject
She said, what's with this dog motif?""
I said,​ do you have something against dogs?""
I am almost completely soulless
I am incapable of being human
I am incapable of being inhuman
I am living uncontrollably
It should be called antidepression
As a friend of mine suggested
Because it's not the sadness that hurts you
It's the brain's reaction against it
It's not enough to love the unreal
I am inseparable from the impossible
I want gravity to stop for me
My soul yearns for a fugitive from the laws of nature
I want a cut scene
I want a cut from your face to my face
I want a cut I want
The next related video
I don't want to go insane
I don't want to have schizophrenia
Part II
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Last night I dreamed he was trying to kill you
I woke up and I was trying to kill you
It's been a year since we first met
I don't know if we're boyfriends yet
Do you have any crimes that, that
We can use to pass the time I am
Running out of drugs to try and I
We said we hated humans
We wanted to be humans

We wanted to be humans
More groceries, get eaten
Get more groceries, get eaten
Get more groceries, get eaten
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
In the mall in the nighttime
You came back alone with a flashlight
It was the start of nothing new backwards)
And it was my favorite scene
I couldn't tell you what it means
But it meant something to me
And pretty soon you'll find some nice young
Satanist with braces and one
Capital O"", significant Other
And you can take him home to your mother and
Say ma, this is my brother""
We said we hated humans

You can feel their smile from the inside
Part III
Last night I dreamed he was trying to kill you
I woke up and I was trying to kill you
Your ears perked up
I perked up when your ears perked up
You were all looking around
And I hoped it was for me
I hoped you were using your sonar systems for me
The ancients saw it coming
You can see that they tried to warn them
In the tales that they told their children
But they fell out of their heads in the morning
They said sex can be frightening
But the children were not listening
And the children cut out everything
Except for the kissing and the singing
When they finally found their homes
At Walt Disney studios
And then everyone grew up
With their fundamental schemas fucked, but, but
But there are lots of fish left in the sea
There are lots of fish in business suits
That talk and walk on human feet
And visit doctors, have weak knees
Oh please let me join your cult
I'll paint my face in your colors
You had a real nice face
I had an early death
The ocean washed over your grave
The ocean washed open your grave
The ocean washed over your grave
The ocean washed open your grave
The ocean washed over your grave

How's your face? How's your body?)
The ocean washed over your grave

Drunk Drivers/Killer Whales,Car Seat Headrest,Teens of Denial,"{'year': 2016, 'month': 3, 'day': 24}","In the backseat of my heart
My love tells me I'm a mess
I couldn't get the car to start
I left my keys somewhere in the mess

It comes and goes in plateaus
One month later, I'm a fucking pro
My parents would be proud
Or fall asleep on the floor
Forget what happened in the morning
There are notes in your handwriting
But you can't make it out

We are not a proud race
It's not a race at all
We're just trying
I'm only trying to get home
Drunk drivers, drunk drivers
This is not a good thing
I don't mean to rationalize
Or try and explain it away
It's not okay
Drunk drivers, drunk drivers

It's too late to articulate it
That empty feeling
You share the same fate as the people you hate
You build yourself up against others' feelings
And it left you feeling empty as a car coasting downhill
I have become such a negative person
It was all just an act
It was all so easily stripped away

But if we learned how to live like this
Maybe we can learn how to start again
Like a child who's never done wrong
Who hasn't taken that first step

We are not a proud race
It's not a race at all
We're just trying
I'm only trying to get home
Drunk drivers, drunk drivers
Put it out of your mind
And perish the thought
There's no comfort in responsibility
Drunk drivers, drunk drivers
It doesn't have to be like this
It doesn't have to be like this
It doesn't have to be like this
Killer whales, killer whales
It doesn't have to be like this
It doesn't have to be like this
It doesn't have to be like this
Killer whales, killer whales

Here's that voice in your head
Giving you shit again
But you know he loves you
And he doesn't mean to cause you pain
Please listen to him
It's not too late
Turn off the engine
Get out of the car
And start to walk

Drunk drivers
Drunk drivers
Drunk drivers
Drunk drivers
It doesn't have to be like this
It doesn't have to be like this
It doesn't have to be like this
Killer whales, killer whales
It doesn't have to be like this
It doesn't have to be like this
It doesn't have to be like this
Killer whales, killer whales
Ahhh
Whales... ahhh
Whales... ahhh yeah yeah...
Whales... oh oh oh oh oh"

The ripping of the tape hurts my ears
In my years, I've never seen anyone quit quite like you do
Twin bruises on my shins
From where I kicked the back of the seat in
They meant what I went through for you
But now they're fading, now they're gone

Don't)
Don't spend too much time on it)

Don't spend too much time on it)

These teenage hands will never touch yours again
But I remember you
You had a body
You had hands and arms and legs and et cetera
Did I fail? Did I fall?
In the morning when I wake up, are you mine?)
Did I waste my time, waste my time on a broken heart?
Take the trash out like a bad dream, are you gone?)
Or is this the start of the great silence?
From the old house, the fiercest heart spoke, are you mine?)
Is this the start of every day?
Christmas tree's dead, you know how time flies, are you gone?)
I'm not gonna end up a nervous wreck
Like the people I know who are nervous wrecks
Though I'm not gonna name names
Yours was an exception)
Did the sound just stop?
At the end of every day
There'll be nothing left to say
There'll be no backstage pass
We gotta go back
We gotta go back
We gotta go back
We gotta go back
We gotta go back
We've gotta go back)

Don't spend too much time on it)
Don't get too impressed
You might lose your breath
Don't predict your death
'Cause I like you the best
Don't you fall apart
You might lose my heart

So descend into cliché
If you've found your holy grail
The ocean washed over your grave)
I could fill back in that grave
I could hammer in that nail
The ocean washed open your grave)
I could give you what you want
I could give you what you deserve
The ocean washed over your grave)
I could sing another song
I could watch that hammer swerve
The ocean washed open your grave)
And when the mirror breaks
I wouldn't miss it for the world
The ocean washed over your grave)
Call it blackstar, call it painstar
The same thing happens when you touch it
The ocean washed open your grave)
Let me tell you, did they tell you what happens when you touch it? Did they tell you?
The ocean washed over your grave)
Let me tell you what happens when you touch it, let me tell you, let me, let me, let me, let me, let me, let me, let me, let me, let me, let me, let me, let-
The ocean washed open your grave)
Let me
Let me in
So descend into cliché
If the music has forsaken you
Roll the stone over the grave
I never liked that one anyways
Or stare into the face
Of whatever it is that's facing you
And if the levee breaks
You'll find out what it is that's replacing you
And when the mirror breaks
I wouldn't miss it for the world
Call it blackstar, call it painstar
The same thing happens when you touch it
Did they tell you what happens when you touch it?
Did they tell you what happens when you touch it?
Did they tell you...
Did they tell me...
What happened to you?

Love-
I gain nothing - I have love, I gain nothing - I have love...
If I give all I possess to the poor all I possess to the poor) and give over my body to hardship over my body to hardship) that I may boast, but do not have love, I gain nothing - I gain nothing
Love is patient, love is kind. It does not envy, it does not boast-
Love does not delight in evil, but rejoices with the truth. It always protects, always trusts, always hopes, always perseveres-

Love never fails. But where there are prophecies, they will cease; where there are tongues, they will be stilled; where there is knowledge, it will pass away. For we know in part and we prophesy in part, but when completeness comes, what is in part disappears
When I was a child, I talked like a child, I thought like a child, I reasoned like a child. At the end of my childhood, I put these ways behind me. For now,​ we see only a reflection as in a mirror; then we shall see face to face. Now I know in part; then I shall know fully, even as I am fully known
And now these two remain:"

I'm so sick of, fill in the blank
Accomplish more, accomplish nothing

So I can beat up the rest of me

You have no right to be depressed
You haven't tried hard enough to like it
Haven't seen enough of this world yet
But it hurts, it hurts, it hurts, it hurts
Well, stop your whining, try again
No one wants to cause you pain
They're just trying to let some air in
But you hold your breath, you hold your breath, you hold it
Hold my breath, I hold my breath, I hold it

I've known for a long time
I'm not getting what I want out of people
It took me a long time
To figure out I don't know what I want
You'll ask, Why?"", and there will be no answer
Then you'll ask, For how long?"", and there will be no answer
Then you'll ask, What can I do?"", and there will be no answer
And eventually, you will shut up

You have no right to be depressed

Well, stop your whining, try again
No one wants to cause you pain

But you hold your breath, you hold your breath, you hold it
Hold my breath, I hold my breath, I hold it

I get signs
From the cops
Saying, Stay the fuck down""
I get signs
From the audience
Saying, Stay the fuck down""
I get signs
From God
Saying, Stay the fuck down""

You haven't tried hard enough to like it)
I have seen too much of this world, yes
Haven't seen enough of this world yet)
But it hurts, it hurts, it hurts, it hurts
And I will never see the light
So stop your whining, try again)
That I've seen shining in your eyes
No one wants to cause you pain)
You just want to see me naked
They're just trying to let some air in, but you)

I mean, I'm sick of meaning
I just wanna hold you
But that's not what I wanted to say at all
I mean, I'm sick of meaning
I just wanna hold you
Is it the chorus yet?)

No. It's just a building of the verse
So when the chorus does come
It'll be more rewarding

I would speak to you in song
But you can't sing
As far as I'm aware
Though everyone can sing
As you are well aware
I keep so quiet it's hard to tell I'm alive

Everybody is swinging their hips now)
Everybody is giving the waitress tips
Everybody's dancing all of the dances
Everybody's dancing every dance right now!

Those are you got some nice shoulders
I'd like to put my hands around them
I'd like to put my hands around them

I have enough trouble controlling my own limbs
Stealing alcohol from our parents and grandparents
There's no devil on one shoulder and angel on the other

These are the people that I fell in love with

Let's pull out the nail with the back of the hammer
These are the people that I get drunk with)

Well, so what?
We're young
We're thin most of us)
We're alive most of us)
Don't you realize our bodies could fall apart at any second?
I am terrified your body could fall apart at any second
Those are you got some nice shoulders
I'd like to put my hands around them
I'd like to put my hands around them

We can get real horny and keep messing around
We can keep real quiet, won't be making no sound
I'll try my best not to touch your face
Next time can we please meet at my place?

And I know that I don't talk a lot
But I know that you don't care a lot
As long as we move our bodies around a lot
We'll forget that we forgot how to talk
When we dance, when we
When we dance, when we

Out from the forest adjacent to your garage

Such a good idea
If it turns you on
We have breakdowns Oh, oh, oh)
And sometimes we don't have breakdowns No, no, no)
I want to hear you going psycho

The Ballad of the Costa Concordia,Car Seat Headrest,Teens of Denial,"{'year': 2016, 'month': 5, 'day': 20}","I used to like the mornings
Id survived another night
Id walk to breakfast through the garden
See the flowers stretching in the sunlight
Now I wake up in the mornings
And all the kindness is drained out of me
I spend hours just wincing
And trying to regain some sense of peace

If only I could sustain my anger
Feel it grow stronger and stronger
It sharpens to a point and sheds my skin
Shakes off the weight of my sins
And takes me to heaven

I stay up late every night
Out of some general protest
But with no one to tell you to come to bed
Its not really a contest
And maybe you think
Ill learn from my mistake
But not this time
Its just gonna break me

If only I could sustain my anger
Feel it grow stronger and stronger
It sharpens to a point and sheds my skin
Shakes off the weight of my sins
And takes me to heaven

And if Ive lost you for good
Could there have been any other way?
Was the water filling up for years
Or did I wreck it all in a day?
Im going to bed now
Ive sunk into my sorrows
And itll take three hundred million dollars
To get me up tomorrow
I wont go down with this shit
I will put my hands up and surrender
There will be no more flags above my door
I have lost, and I always will be
It was an expensive mistake
It was an expensive mistake
My horse broke his back to get me here
I have his blood on my hands for no reason
But what was I supposed to do?
How was I supposed to know how to use a tube amp?
How was I supposed to know how to drive a van?
How was I supposed to know how to ride a bike without hurting myself?
How was I supposed to know how to make dinner for myself?
How was I supposed to know how to hold a job?
How was I supposed to remember to grab my backpack after I set it down to play basketball?
And how was I supposed to know how to not get drunk every
Thursday, Friday, Saturday, and — why not — Sunday?
How was I supposed to know how to steer this ship?)
How was I supposed to know how to steer this ship?
How the hell was I supposed to steer this ship?
It was an expensive mistake
You cant say youre sorry and its over
I was given a body that is falling apart
My house is falling apart
And I was given a mind that can't control itself
And what about the pain Im in right now?)
And I was given a ship that can't steer itself
And what about a vacation?)
And what about a vacation to feel good?
My horse broke his back and left me here
And how was I supposed to know?
And God wont forgive me
And you wont forgive me
Not unless I open up my heart
And how am I supposed to do that
When I go to this same room every night
And sleep in the same bed every night?
The same fucking bed
With the red comforter with the white stripes
And the yellow ceiling light that makes me feel like Im dying
This sea is too familiar
How many nights have I drowned here?
How many times have I drowned?
How many times have I drowned?)
I give up
I give up

Let us take you back to where we came in
We were united, an undivided nation
We got divided, it was something inside us
And it was not us
We were so naive, we were just like animals
Told what to believe by the beasts who took control
We wanted control too, but that was normal
'Cause our life was one of survival
The decisions we've made, if you can call it deciding
With your life on the line, it'd be social suicide to change your mind
So we got mad and we split the scene
Now we download all of our shit for free
It's the new economy, we have nothing to offer and we sleep on trash

I give up
Let us take you back to where you came in
A man clinging to the cliff of revelation
So scared of what he would find, he started crying
It was not me""
Stopped at the borderline, they stripped his disguise
So he read a book that won a Pulitzer prize
It was about death, it didn't help
He saw himself in it
And he was disturbed at the conclusions that it led to
But he couldn't say what because the author was dead too
And so though he made fun of us
He has now become one of us

I give up
I give up
I give up
I give up
I give up
I give up
I give up

And you wake up trembling
From a dream where I swam into the river
I reach out and hold you in my arms
I love you, I love you, I love you"

It was intense, it was an intense process, and it was how I was trying to - very hard, personify that intensity, but it's hard to talk about her now, because I think she wasn't me, at least that's how I feel and I'm trying to figure out what to do now
But she represents fervor in woman, she is powerful, yet fragile, she dares but also averts her gaze, and I love her, at least - I did, and - but now I feel lost, and I'm unsure of what to think and feel most of the time
But I did believe in her, The Lady"", and maybe, there is a different form now that the intensity takes

Behind every great love story
Lies a great suicide
You can't give yourself completely
And keep the man inside
All the sentences I climbed halfway
Saw the heights of what I wanted to say
And crawled from word to word
Trying to get back down

The unending realization
That it's never gonna end
I spend half the day exhaling
And the other half holding my breath
Cause living underwater was never my strength
In the depths you reside, the sun never sinks
So lets float to the bottom for one final drink
Theres time for one more tonight

Its time to forget while the forgettings good
Ill burn all the promises I carved out of your woulds
You said won't you come into arm's reach
Abandon your clothes and modes of speech
An infant reborn you shall be
Helpless and afraid

Im waving goodbye every time you go to the store
I hope you break your hand the next time you slam the door
Because I burned my fingers every night
When your own shaking hands wouldnt give you a light
And I said Jesus Christ, my parents were right
I never shouldve smoked you out”

Id hate to amputate this artificial limb
But staring at you, my glass eyes are growing dim
I cant even blame you for looking so smug
I have to admit youre a hell of a drug
So pack up the boxes, roll me up with the rug
Im not moving out, Im just moving
Kissed) I kissed you, yes, but never on the mouth
Masochist) You held the north while I conquered the south
But I don't want a territorial breach
So at the edge of the bed, we'll meet
And I want you to fuck me in your sleep
It's the only way I'll ever know that you love me
Cause there's always gotta be a new angle)
Guns are loaded with silver bullets tonight
But its useless, you kept me waiting until it was light
These things are yours)
But you cant go out the way you came in
In the arms of someone unaware of your sins
Because Ive been recording this whole fucking thing
Now you can never use the same chord changes again
The first time was too fast
The second time was just sad)

If youre wondering why Im still willing to take the fall
If Im not getting fucked over, Im not getting fucked at all
But I never asked for immunity
Thats the difference between you and me
All I wanted was someone who was just like me
And I hate myself for that

Its getting hard to talk about the past
When youve copyrighted the present, no questions asked
You can do whatever you want with my name
But my bodys never been public domain
So if youre looking for somebody to blame
Blame Walt Disney Studios

I remember​ I was walking around outside, talking to you on the phone
We were both avoiding the parties we attended alone
And I looked up at the drunken moon
It was round and it was grey and it looked like the moon
And I said, at least weve both got the moon”
And you said, Im inside”

So Ill try loving again
And youll try living alone
And well meet at the end of this lifetime
And compare notes
If bitterness is all that I have left
Ill be better at being bitter than anybody else)

You were disappointed and I didn't know why

I drove off to go buy some stuff
Which was a mistake because
I didn't want to come back

And dabbed at my thumb, which was bleeding for some reason
Leaving a trail of red blossoms on the napkin

Will I find out
That I am just people too?
Please say that one more time?
Um, yeah, I mean, uh, the intent was to sort of go back to these periods and, and revisit them a little bit, especially with Teens of Style. You know, with Teens of Denial it was sort of contemporaneous when I was writing it. You know, and what I was experiencing at the time. And, uh, I guess I was just out of my teenage years when I was writing things for Teens of Denial. I didn't really feel like anything had changed. So, um, yeah I guess, you know, the two of those albums together are sort of, they're both an exploration of past feelings and how they connect to the present and what I'm doing in the present tense
I'm sorry, you'll have to say that again
The connection must be bad. Um, can you try one more time?

For the Lord is about to pass by.""
Now there was a great wind
So strong that it was splitting mountains
And breaking rocks in pieces before the Lord

And after the wind an earthquake

And after the earthquake a fire
But the Lord was not in the fire;

Earlier in the song I used the term galvanistic,"" and galvanism is the concept, uh, the obsolete scientific theory that there is a kind of electricity flowing through our bloodstreams, and that was our life force. I used the term because I came across it in, uh, Mary Shelley's, uh, Frankenstein"", and that book is sort of an exploration of the theme of creating a character, of making up a person. So I used the term galvanistic"" to allude to that book as a sort of a symbol of how I, like, created you as a character.

He was dependent on social acceptance
Just like every other human

Poorly done murals, the faces
If there wasnt a house
We would build one with our bodies
Hang on to my ego
Everything is coming loose tonight
Im too nervous for boys now
Im too nervous for girls now

Every plastic cup that can't be recycled in this town

It wasnt educational

I only wanted you to be different

But your flesh seems so solid
Why does it melt away
In the morning dew?
Im sorry, I thought someone was there
Like two mirrors gazing into each others eyes
Like two microphones kissing

But oh, those lights, those colors!

We are alone in our dreams
Do we have to sleep tonight?

Building towards a meaning thatll never come
Leave someone beautiful
Find someone horrible

I just want to fuck you
I just want to have sex with you

I stretch into a smile
Not just my face, my body, my soul

I thought it would
But it didn't
When everyone was going homewards
Did you cry because it was over?
Or did you cry because you knew it would never end?
As long as we dont go to sleep yet
I promise I cant go to sleep yet
'Cause the nights not dead, no the nights not dead
I will not go alone to my singlesize bed
I don't know what that means
We could go anywhere
But we will always be where we are
We could go anywhere
But we will always be where we are

Watching people trying to act sober on the other side of the sea
Until I laughed and headed home
I learned my lesson never to roam"

But I hope that you find someone who loves you very much

No, Ive never slept next to someone who wanted to sleep next to me
It was hard to debate, you couldnt wait to lose your memory
And it didnt take long, you were strong in your resolve to lose your mind
It was only a mistake that on the way you happened to lose mine

Yes, I know in your eyes we were never really lovers as such
So I hope that you find someone who loves you very much
And I hope that you find someone you can love just as much

Sometimes I wish I hadnt taken all my notes on your rolling papers
But when you burned them the scent came as such a bittersweet vapor
I watched the flames silence the words I was given in life
But if your heart was in it, I was glad to be your sacrifice

Shining on my laptop monitor

Nervous like a wild dog
Waiting for the attack

I was living in the delta
And wasting most of my time
You know if I could close the blinds right
I could sleep all through the night

Where once there was a shore
I can still remember houses
Stripped to the floor

That holds us together
There must be more than wind
That takes us away
There must be more than tears

When you're down for a while trying to get dried out
You feel the time pass by but you don't look around
When you're out for a while trying to get dried out
You feel the time pass by but you don't look around
You were playing your music but you got drowned out
You go back to the old house but you've been locked out
And it wasn't for love that you went back home
It was the guilt in your throat like you swallowed a bone
They had all of your life to get it right
They had all of that time just to change their minds
And you're grateful for the bus, it's a place to sit down
Like a spider in the winter trying not to be found
No use trying to heal when you're getting stepped on
No use selling your soul when you're getting passed on
How could they treat you like a forgotten card?
Dear dad"", I'm sorry"", Thank you very much""
What difference does it make when they throw you away?
Is anybody ever gonna hear what you had to say?

I was flying on a redeye
My hand dropped to the aisle
I could see myself clearly
For the first time in a while
There was nothing but lines
Nothing but outlines
My gut sank like a stone
But I heard another voice say
We all walk alone""

Mend the fence with the best of grace

Everything you do is water under it
These were not the original lyrics
Such a worthless waste of time to write about

Every bit of you that I don't love
Is filled up with my hate
I was a situation
That you were glad went away

Move move forward like a human being
Sometimes you have to kill things to impress your friends
You probably looked like an idiot in that hat
Used to feel bad about crushing ants

Why why why why why to die)
I can't go back to not understanding what you mean to me
Why why why why why to die)
Im turning into the person that you were afraid Id turn out to be


There is something in me that can only give
There is something in you that can only give out
When you hear my songs, do you get that feeling?
And if not, what the hell were you hearing?

I am not crazy, I am right
What do you mean? What are you saying to me?
I was just another bird you touched
Whose mother won't take him back

Im sorry I misheard your lyrics
Tried to smile but it didnt show up in the photograph
I was searching for a soul to sell my devils to
All I wanted was sleep and you took it away

Why why why why why to die)
Did you do something wrong, was there something you did that I could blame
Yes yes yes yes yes I dislike I hate)
I thought I was open, I thought I was intimate, and then you asked me my name

By the time they send the lifeboats
I wont want to leave the island
Calling out to distant shorelines
Calling out for different basslines

I cant go back to not understanding what you mean to me
Im turning into the person that you were afraid that Id turn out to be
Did you do something wrong, was there something you did that I could blame
I thought I was open, I thought I was intimate, and then you asked me my name

Ooh, it was nothing special
Ooh, it was nothing sacred
Just hands held
And shoulders rubbed
And voices touched
In holy harmony"

But all I ever had was my heart

In a bed miles from home
But Im too old to get a new start

But my voice is too weak

And Ive been trying like hell
To wake myself up

You breathe your last breath
And all that I hold is cold embers
And I sing in your ear
But theres nothing to hear
Just a night owl in burial chambers
You say that you love me
And I write it all down
So when youre gone Ill remember
But as I get old I find
I cant trust my own mind
And your words all break down into laughter

Not yet dried on my face
No comfort in the cold light of morning

And old men dream dreams
And it all amounts to a warning

The shitty thing about having artist friends is getting into the front seat of their car and having to rest your feet on fast food burger wrappers and empty Gatorade bottles

Let's stare each other in the face
Don't tell me we are not in space

The rags we ended up with

I'll need to see you when I'm dead
I said you know that when we kiss
It's never on the lips, so

You can talk

You can talk!

Sometimes a cigarette
Is just a phallic symbol
I've come up sporting half a haircut
That scissors couldn't fix
And sometimes a cigarette
Is just a good way to die
My legs around your back
I just needed words to sing

Never look me in the eye
'Cause yours see so much more than mine

The rags with which we ended up

For sure that you've moved on

Everyone cried​ when they saw with their eyes

I was living in the past cause Ill be dead in the future
The kids from ED, they smelled bad, I had to teach one how to
Unzip his backpack, sitting on my dads lap
As he taught me to play piano, but I could only play by ear
Spent his money on whores when he came back from the war
He just needed something pure, and he'd tell me these stories
And one night they stole the boats, went for a smoke on the water
And we march, across, the countryside
We march, across, the countryside
Not by sickness, God, not by sickness
Wanted to find you in a hotel room, elevator shafts
But Im tired of this honeymoon, bored in the bed with you
My dad called me fag"" even though he had slept with men
I swear that VHS is ingrained in my memory
Just like everything, just the historian
Only comfort I can take, Rome was not forgotten in a day

Wash the glitter off your face
Hands in the sink, pray for Gods grace

From the womb of the theater to the light of day
But youve got something to think about on the ride home
And youve got something to talk about if youre not alone

Outside the walls I hear sirens
Fade to black, dramatic irony
Before my eyes, after the previews
I can relate, you do what we do
So Im alive in the final act
The spirits did it all in an hour and a half
Bring me to pain, bring me to relief
Turn off my brain, suspend my disbelief

Theres a beautiful score Ill never hear
When my vision blurs, it rings in my ears
I must be saved
I must be saved before the end
Theres a wonderful line I cant remember
I cant rewind, so I better remember
I must be saved
I must be saved before the end

The hero stands up and the blood rushes out of his head
But you can still see him breathing after hes dead
And after the soul is gone, his bodys back to himself
And youll say Oh, who is he? I've seen him in something else”

And so I pray to the movie screen
That Ill be shown something Ive never seen
A revelation, I can sense it
But this part dont make any sense yet
If heaven is a film that never ends
And the characters are all my friends
Or is that what we call a tv show?
Or is that the real life that were living now?

Theres a beautiful score Ill never hear

I must be saved
I must be saved before the end
Theres a wonderful line I cant remember
I cant rewind so I better remember

Gone up towards the border where the freaks live
I couldn't tolerate it, yet somehow I did
If it had been on TV, I would've changed the channel
And afterwards I lay awake for quite some time
And thought about opinions I'd kept
At five in the morning, I couldn't tolerate it
How many had died while I slept?

Now is the time to cast Darwin aside
Stop spinning lines that justify the lure of suicide
And reach out your hands
And save someone's life
Because war is coming
If you want it
War is coming
If you want it

She's keeping quiet in a season of crime
Walking away as if nothing had changed
From that awful display
People are strange
If they keep on laughing
Nothing will change

And try to create some space between the lines
To lift up your voice
And change someone's mind

And he's here
Oh, well slip in sideways
Never laid my eyes on it

When will my man come?

Trapped in somebody's arms
I need someone to put a roof between me and these stars

My empty body's too full of anger to let anyone in
I've got my reasons
So fill me with sin
And leave the next season
Cold glass warm shatters into shards
If the winter doesn't kill me then the thaw will stop my heart

Heard somebody singing
He said my heart is sinking
Could have stayed, so why did I run?
When will I be the one
To someone?
When will my man come?
Help me with what I found out
Nothing ever has to work out
Only chance and choice of freedom
Dont have to be rich fun or handsome

Yeah, that's a really good movie, yeah, uh, really powerful movie too, I mean, basically destroyed my relationship with my dad, um, 'cause, uh, he and- he and my mom were watching one night and I was there too, we're all- we're all watching it and um, um, it's really long, it's like three hours long, and it has this weird violent ending so after the credits started rolling, I was, like, just jokingly like, what a bad ending,"" but um, I mean obviously I was joking I wouldn't have sat there for fucking three hours if I had actually thought the movie was bad but I mean, my dad got all pissed. So, next time he started up a movie, um, I was in the room when, like, I had been reading when we started the movie, and he turned the lights off so I couldn't read anymore, so I w- I put the book away and started watching the movie and it was 'Zabriskie Point' which, you know, I probably wanted to see that movie longer than he because it had this Pink Floyd soundtrack and they never released it on album or anything so, you know, I wanted to watch it for years. So, ten minutes into the movie he pauses it, and he turns to me and he says, he tells me he doesn't want me to watch movies with him and my mom anymore and would I please leave the room and, you know, so I was just like, oh. Okay. And I walwalked out of the room, I mean, and I​ was just so pissed off and angry and hurt, and I mean, why, why the fuck would he do that? I mean, like, he has- he has this teenage son, a teenager who likes the same movies that he does, and has a similar taste to him, I mean, he should be fucking celebrating- he should be fucking embracing that and instead he fucking kicked me out of the room, so, I mean. It's not that he didn't want, like- 'Zabriskie Point', it has like a sex scene and everything but its not like he actually cared about me not seeing that, and I, I know that he doesn't care because the next day, he offered to let me- he offers to let me borrow it and- and watch it on my own, and I was like, thanks a fucking lot. I really want to watch this movie by myself after you kicked me out last night. But, um, yeah, that's basically, uh, when I started- or, when I just lost all respect for my dad. That and my, uh, seventeenth birthday party. Well, it wasn't a party, it was just me and my family, uh. Uh, we were eating cake, you know, I'd opened presents and we'd had a nice birthday dinner, and we were just topping off the evening with some cake, and I was- I was fine, I was perfectly happy, and my sister, uh was talking to my mother, and she was imitating her boyfriend. My sister's boyfriend. My sister was imitating her boyfriend, uh, talking with, like, a highpitched voice, this highpitched, you know, annoying voice, not that loudly, I mean, I wasn't- I wasn't paying attention, I was just eating my cake, I was fine, but my dad just interrupts her in the middle of it, and he says… oh, what did he say, he said, like, yap yap yap, I just wanna eat without hearing any of this shrieking, and, you know, just something incredibly rude like that. So, you know, my sister's face fell, there was just this dead silence for like, minutes, everybody's just, like, picking at their cake, noone's actually- everybody lost their appetite now and then after a couple minutes my dad just walked out of the fucking room and tosses his cake in the garbage. You know, fucking ruined my birthday, so, um, uh, after that I didn't really want anything to do with my father but, um. Yeah, uh, 'Shortcuts' is a really good movie, yeah, we should definitely see that some time."""

She'd already caught her flight early in the morning
Beds were offered, beds were made
But there's always a hotel room, waiting
You wouldn't want the night to not belong to you

Talking into her sweatshirt, moving her hands in front of her face
Her mortal frame suffocated by fame
When she'd ask for none, just got fucked by good luck
And I, and I and I, and I, I didn't give a shit

Will you still produce heat?
When are you gonna get an album out?
Would you want to climb the ladder? The rungs are prison bars
Put your feet on the frozen floor
Glide around from man to fan
And maybe you can find someone who won't ask any questions
Is that what you want? Is that what you need?

When you said you loved me
The start of nothing
I had no chance to prepare
I couldn't see you coming
The start of nothing new
I could hate you now
It's quite alright to hate me now
We both know that deep down
The feeling still deep down is good

You know I'd break in
To the empty heart
That you keep my face in
Deleted scenes where I took off my shirt back then
You couldn't take off work back then

Took out all the mids back then, yeah

No matter what I did
I couldn't fucking sing back then
Everything sucked back then

In the mall in the nighttime
You came back alone with a flashlight
Had to admit, I couldn't see it ending well back then
You were dressed to kill back then
You ain't a kid no more
We'll never be those kids at all

I broke your heart last week
You'll probably feel better by the weekend
Still remember, had you going crazy
Screaming my name

Feathers like these can be used as bait
I'm tying the drawstrings closed
I think that dragging you down is the way to go
And I'm sorry I was mean last night
But you rattle my cage with such apparent delight
It's an act that demands satisfaction
And it's the only way to get some action

I keep feeling fascination
Burning passion, love so strong
I keep feeling fascination
Looking, learning, moving on
I feel it
You'll feel it
You'll feel it
I feel it
You'll feel it
Feel it, feel it, feel it
Feel it, feel it, feel it"

Into mansions and Monroeses
Logic and hypnosis
Good and evil

yearolds on pills waking up in beds of big producers

I can make you something

Remembering when you were mine in a still suburban town
When every Thursday I'd brave those mountain passes
And you'd skip your early classes, and we'd learn how our bodies worked

God damn the black night, with all of its revelation
I've become what I always hated when I was with you then
We looked like giants in the back of my grey subcompact
Fumbling to make contact as the others slept insidе

And together therе
In a shroud of frost, the mountain air
Began to pass
Through every pane of weathered glass
I held you closer
Than anyone would ever guess

Do you remember NMH. and OTC
And reading aloud from magazines?
I don't know about you, but I swear on my name they could smell it on me
But I've never been too good with secrets, no

And together there
In a shroud of frost, the mountain air
Began to pass
Through every pane of weathered glass

My love tells me I'm a mess
I couldn't get the car to start
I left my keys somewhere in the mess

It comes and goes in plateaus
One month later, I'm a fucking pro
My parents would be proud
Or fall asleep on the floor
Forget what happened in the morning
There are notes in your handwriting
But you can't make it out

We are not a proud race
It's not a race at all
We're just trying
I'm only trying to get home
Drunk drivers, drunk drivers
This is not a good thing
I don't mean to rationalize
Or try and explain it away
It's not okay
Drunk drivers, drunk drivers

It's too late to articulate it
That empty feeling
You share the same fate as the people you hate
You built yourself up against others' feelings
And it left you feeling empty as a car coasting downhill
I have become such a negative person
It was all just an act
It was all so easily stripped away

But if we learn how to live like this
Maybe we can learn how to start again
Like a child who's never done wrong
Who hasn't taken that first step

We are not a proud race
It's not a race at all
We're just trying
I'm only trying to get home

Giving you shit again
But you know he loves you
And he doesn't want to cause you pain
Please listen to him
It's not too late
Turn off the engine
Get out of the car
And start to walk

And the disconnected lines, that were arranged in the letter 'i'
Walked up to the window, and pressed it against my nose
And held hands with the people to my left and right
Black or white there was no, difference in that neon glow
And we told the world that this establishment was open for business
Yes that neon sign, that opened my eyes
And the disconnected lines, in the shape of the letter 'i'
Saw the neon sign, that disturbed my eyes
And my disconnected mind, told me everything was fine
And I voiced my sighs, to the neon sky
And the Lord came down in a glowing light
And the glowing light was the neon sign, that destroyed my eye
And the disconnected lines, in the shape of the letter 'i'

It's so bitter, I thought you were better than that
And it feels like a big deal
You got no comfort zone
You must be getting lonely
Used to be the only fucker with potential on you
And you were in talks to sell out to Satan
But after a while, they stopped respondin'
So you started reblogging genderqueer stuff
And you lost a lot of friends
It was a big deal
Whoa, whoa)

Everyone falls in the bathroom this time and
Everyone said that we want albums
So keep on being an asshole to everyone

Yeah, I​ got mind control
I'm almost always good to go
But tonight I ate too much
And I'm still thinking about my insurance
Yeah, you know how that feels"

There were signs on the road that warned me of stop signs
The speed limit kept decreasing by ten
As we entered a town about halfway there
It was almost raining at the train station
We put our hoods on our heads at the train station
We threw rocks into the river
The river underneath the train tracks
And when the train came it was so big and powerful
When it came into the little station
I wanted to put my arms around it
But the conductor looked at me funny
So we had to say goodbye and leave
The Monopoly board still in the backseat
Took that nightmare left turn to get out of town
Ran into the decreasing speed limits again

Hangovers feel good when I know its the last one
Then I feel so good that I have another one
Last Friday, I took acid and mushrooms
I did not transcend, I felt like a walking piece of shit
In a stupid looking jacket
So I walked around town and felt like I was in Sodom
There were filthy people seeking comfort for their bodies
It was so obscene
Filled with loathing and religious fervor
I laid on my friends bedroom floor for an hour
And tried not to piss my pants

And then I saw Jesus
And he said

Who are you to go against the word of my father?"" And
Who are you? The scum of the Earth”
No we are just, we are just, we are just teens of style
Oh we are just, we are just, we are just teens of style

There were people getting drunk, there were people getting high
They were falling to pieces right before my eyes
And I said mmhmm” a lot
And there was one guy there who kept asking me how does it feel?""
And I didnt even know how to begin to answer that question
So I just said I don't want to talk about it""
So there I was, just another shitbag civilian
Afraid of the cops when I was outside, afraid of my friends when I was inside
And I grew tired of the scene

And then my dad showed up
And all my friends sang along when he said

Who are you to go against the word of our fathers?”
Yeah, it goes Who are you? The scum of the Earth”
No, we are just, we are just, we are just teens of style
No, we are just, we are just victims, victims of the contemporary style

Deep, in the deepest cycle of sleep
An endless series of words
Meaningless words
Streamlined
Clauses without a verb
Without reference
Passing by
In the simple rhythm
Like scenery
Passing by the window of a dream
Slowly at first
Then faster and faster
Until eventually
As some unknown mechanism
Meaning is found
Inside the word
Meaning
Connects the words
And light
Passes before your eyes
My eyes
I have eyes
That's smoke
Smoke fills my lungs
I have lungs
And memories
Start to fill this empty head
Have I been here before?

I am not I am not what I'm not, I'm alive, live

Abandoned hallways with the lights flickering

It was much darker at the time, don't you know?
The color's faded out on this video

Vaccines give you autism
And other short stories by
Some fucker you've never heard of

And my child turns into the State
I'm pulling our son out of school
But I think it's too late

It's my child, I'll do what I like
It's my child, I'll do what I like

I took my children to the fields
By the light of the moon
I said don't cry now, don't cry now babies
I promise that we'll get there soon
We looked so pretty all handinhand
And I wiped their tears in the corn
I said look into the stars my littlе babies
A silver ship is coming, and when you see it wе will be reborn


It's my child, I'll do what I like
It's my child, I'll do what I like

In my dream I'm drowning in the romance of the automobile
Everybody is inventing the wheel when they come of age
In a world where we're suffering like Scanners
A mistake that no words of love or magnet's pull
Or bomb or beating shall anull
It's rotten luck, baby rotten luck
I'll say the name if someone can get my groceries today
I feel like a nosebleed
At the graves of Philip K Dick and Jane

There were signs on the road that warned me of stop signs

As we entered a town about halfway there
It was almost raining at the train station
We put our hoods on our heads at the train station
We threw rocks into the river
The river underneath the train tracks
And when the train came it was so big and powerful
When it came into the little station
I wanted to put my arms around it
But the conductor looked at me funny
So we had to say goodbye and leave
The Monopoly board still in the backseat
Took that nightmare left turn to get out of town
Ran into the decreasing speed limits again

Another movie that I didn't watch with you Oh, oh, oh)
Another movie and we're gonna have to move No, no, no)
That final terror is in your house somewhere
Hiding in boxes, behind closed doorways
Out from the forest adjacent to your garage
I've seen its marks at the corner of your eyes

Nothing works for everyone
Good stories are bad lies
Good stories are bad lies

Take your hands off your nеck and hold on to the ghost of my body
You know that good lies make bad storiеs
You can text me
When punching mattresses gets old
Don't think it'll always be this way
Not comforted by anything I say
We were wrecks before we crashed into each other

Such a good idea
If it turns you on
We have breakdowns Oh, oh, oh)
And sometimes we don't have breakdowns No, no, no)
I want to hear you going psycho
If you're going psycho I wanna hear
Every conversation just ends with you screaming
Not even words, just ahahahahahh
Heyeyey
Ohohoh
Heyeyey

Take my hands off your neck and hold on to the ghost of your body
I know that good lies make bad stories
You can text me
When punching mattresses gets old
What if it'll always be this way?
Not comforted by anything you say
We were wrecks before we crashed into each other

I dreamed of ordinary faces
Frozen unexpressed emotions
Trapped inside the wax museum
And what my mind had been curating
Scandalized my sense of station
My face burned red, then I woke up feeling like shit
When I saw my ordinary face
I should start lifting weights

Put your heart on the target
They expect you to scream
Music blasts through the market
It's the sound of machines
Quarters crushed into pennies
One thought turned into many
My resistance is crushed
I'm just here to buy some tangerines
And maybe grapes without seeds

'Cause I believe
That thoughts can change your body
It's all on me
If thoughts can change your body
I believe
That thoughts can change your body
It dawned on me
Your body can change your mind

And maybe if I keep my mouth shut
God will answer all my prayers
Let my secret vision sprawl
Declassified and mine to share
And then I'd put my arms around you
And say, Thank God that I've found you""
I kept my mouth shut
And hoped that this would happen to me

I see the patterns in things
I never knew this was a part of me
A wolf sings in the choir
I feel the tension
I'm afraid it will break
I should start lifting weights

'Cause I believe
That thoughts can change your body
It's all on me

It comes and goes in plateaus
One month later, I'm a fucking pro

Or fall asleep on the floor
Forget what happened in the morning
There are notes in your handwriting
But you can't make it out

We are not a proud race
It's not a race at all

I don't mean to rationalize
Or try and explain it away

It's too late to articulate it
That empty feeling
You share the same fate as the people you hate
You build yourself up against others' feelings
And it left you feeling empty as a car coasting downhill
I have become such a negative person
It was all just an act
It was all so easily stripped away

But if we learned how to live like this
Maybe we can learn how to start again
Like a child who's never done wrong
Who hasn't taken that first step

We are not a proud race

But you know he loves you
And he doesn't mean to cause you pain

Every letter was above the line
My Ps and Qs raised their stems
So nothing crossed beneath
I'm a little better now

You never lifted your voice
You never raised your hand
You never showed me your inhuman
You understand

Art gets what it wants and art gets what it deserves

Most people are jokes, but you're so real
Most of the timе that I use the word you""
Well, you know that I'm mostly singing about you
You sworе you'd never use the face that your ex invented
So let's meet up in uncanny valley

You never raised your hand

Life Worth Missing (Dntel Remix),Car Seat Headrest,MADLO: Remixes [EP],"{'year': 2021, 'month': 6, 'day': 22}","They lit a firework
The sky reeled back and I ran fast to get to you
I think you knew
Before the war began
What loving to run towards something can do to a man
Fall over the edge, learn to live while falling
Every laugh is a path worth following
When you put it into words, it's comfortingly bland
Theres so little left to understand
When we're strung up, hanging from the knots we've allowed
We call up our angels to cut us down
If you could be proud of anything youve done
What would it be?"" Then they disappear and wе are up in the clouds
I feel the tеnsion shock right through my body
I am wide awake
Shake a laugh from me
I thought one day, I thought I'd find a hole
In my own backyard I'd never seen before
Follow it down underneath that fence
Come back up on the other side, live another life
Break down the door, it's yours for the taking
I held it back until you stopped asking
My eyes are blurred, the clock is ticking
I'm coming up short in a life worth nothing
I hear women in my head with ordinary names Coming up short in a life worth nothing)
That ring like magic through some malfunction in my brain I'm coming up short in a life worth nothing)
Your hands were warm when we came in from the cold
I took one and held it and suddenly started to shake
Shake
Shake
Shake
I feel it break, I feel the weight
Of anger, pain and sorrow
Breaking over me
The flags are raised
We walk with no goodbyes and no tomorrows
This is destiny
Memories of the best regrets
I play my song in every single rest
Every note of the symphony
Mend the fence with the best of grace
This is pleasantries to the bottom of the page
I'm sorry"

As his friend falls under the wheels
But the headlights don't flinch
And the engine doesn't stutter
Oh yeah
Think about myself
Think about myself
Care about myself
I care about myself
I only care about myself
And other fears too stupid to mention
The ending of Dramamine"" scared Degnan
The way that you all see me
That's who I am, but not who I need to be
Moving my joke body
Through the cold November night
Haha
Hate yourself
Do you hate yourself?
I don't hate myself
I tolerate myself
I wish I was someone else
But it seems too stupid to mention
I know I'll be ripped in heaven

I was young, I was thin
I had money and I loved you
But then came the shabba de bop bop be shibby day, oh yeah
Shabba de bop bop be shibby-
I need a name for what I'm feeling
Then I can start to work on a meaning
Speaking of the shabba de bop bop be shibby day, oh yeah
Shabba de bop bop be shibby day, oh yeah

In a crowded room you will
Hear your own opinion voiced
You can sit back without a word
Watch it spread or fall silent
Oh yeah
If it's too late to speak
I could get out of bed
Find a pencil and write
Leave it for you to find
If the moment is gone
To say I figured out what the problem was
I'd been thinking about it earlier
Hey! Can you hear me now?
Am I alone in my futile efforts?
Sometimes I get so mad
I can't do the few things I usually can
Which is sad
Occupying space
I know I take up space
Will there be a space
For my soul in space?
That's heaven to me

And in the sky, there is a place
Where it's warm, and you're there
And I've got the power now
Yeah, I know what to do
To make you feel something besides pain
'Cause it's the love
That we've come to expect, to deserve
And we touch and it's nice
It's not a complicated mess
And my back doesn't hurt
And your head doesn't tell you to kill yourself
So we smile and embrace
Until we don't know who we are
I can't hear a thing now
I guess I belong to me now
But when night fell on Montana
I found a rest stop completely deserted
But I still felt the eyes upon me
So I drove away"

In four days
If you really wanted
Leaving custom thank you notes
In all the houses
You ever haunted
In this whole solar system
We've only met one type of life
It's the living kind of life
And it's not one I recognize

America

I said excuse me"" to the ocean
Because I thought I had got in its way
At first, I didn't think it heard me
But thеn I saw it wave
You can spend evеry living moment thinking
How can I get out alive?
But is it really then, can you really call it
Hey man, just shut up and drive
I thought we'd be on the road all night
When that ice storm hit in Texas
And when we pulled into the gas station
It was like a frozen oasis

Oh, sweet mama, does that neon sign shine for me?
Is there a street where my name glows all through the night?

And I've never read America)
And I've never been America)
And I never drove America)
And I've never seen America)
Never been America)
I've never been America)

All I want to see America)

All my fantasies are faking orgasms
They're only in it for the money I made up for them
I trade in ideas, opinions, and artistry
And my face is on every dollar
This is heaven but heaven is here
This is heaven but heaven is here)
This is heaven but heaven is hard
This is heaven but heaven is hard)
Because your lover is listening to music you don't know
And you're tangled up in the headphone wires
You know our problems, they don't end
Just because we get boygirlfriends
Is this your salvation plan?
Is this your salvation plan?

There's only one type of love
It's the loving kind of love
But when you're mad at me it's the end of times
And I'm mad at you all the other times

Have I ever really been in love)?
I guess I've never really been in love)
Have I ever really been in love)?
Not in the way I'm thinking been in love)
Haven't really been in love)?
No, I've never really been in love)
Oh, have I ever really been in love)?
No
Real life's a mess
But at least you're not paying rent
You've been making it, maybe even breaking even
You oughta be content
It doesn't make sense
You're still sitting on the fence
When the yard is yours
And it was money well spent

And I've never read
And I've never seen
And I never spoke
And I've never been

They come and they stay for a couple of days

I don't need the complications
I'm just in it for the beating
Its almost a point of pride
They say that it doesn't happen that often

I find it harder to speak
When someone else is listening
In the back of a mеdicine cabinet
You can find your life story
And your futurе in the side effects
