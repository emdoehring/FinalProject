Thinkin Bout You,Frank Ocean,channel ORANGE,"{'year': 2012, 'month': 4, 'day': 17}","A tornado flew around my room before you came
Excuse the mess it made, it usually doesn't rain in
Southern California, much like Arizona
My eyes don't shed tears, but boy, they pour when

I'm thinkin' 'bout you, ooh no, no, no
I've been thinkin' bout you, you know, know, know
I've been thinkin' bout you, do you think about me still?
Do ya, do ya?

Or do you not think so far ahead?
'Cause I been thinkin' bout forever, ooh
Or do you not think so far ahead?
'Cause I been thinkin' bout forever, ooh

No, I don't like you, I just thought you were cool enough to kick it
Got a beach house I could sell you in Idaho
Since you think I don't love you, I just thought you were cute
That's why I kissed you
Got a fighter jet, I don't get to fly it though, I'm lying down

Thinkin' 'bout you, ooh no, no, no
I've been thinkin' bout you, you know, know, know
I've been thinkin' bout you, do you think about me still?
Do ya, do ya?

Or do you not think so far ahead?
'Cause I been thinkin' bout forever, ooh
Or do you not think so far ahead?
'Cause I been thinkin' bout forever, ooh

Yes, of course, I remember, how could I forget How could I forget?) how you feel? How you feel?)
You know you were my first time, a new feel
It won't ever get old, not in my soul, not in my spirit, keep it alive
We'll go down this road 'til it turns from color to black and white

Or do you not think so far ahead?
'Cause I been thinkin' bout forever, ooh
Or do you not think so far ahead?
'Cause I been thinkin' bout forever, ooh"

I'll be the boyfriend in your wet dreams tonight

It's quite alright to hate me now
When we both know that deep down
The feeling still deep down is good

If I could see through walls, I could see you're faking
If you could see my thoughts, you would see our faces
Safe in my rental like an armored truck back then
We didn't give a fuck back then
I ain't a kid no more
We'll never be those kids again
We'd drive to Syd's
Had the X back then, back then
No matter what I did, my waves wouldn't dip back then

In the halls of your hotel
Arm around my shoulder so I could tell
How much I meant to you, meant it sincere back then
We had time to kill back then
You ain't a kid no more, we'll never be those kids again
It's not the same, ivory's illegal, don't you remember?

I broke your heart last week
You'll probably feel better by the weekend
Still remember, had you going crazy
Screamin' my name, the feeling deep down is good

I thought that I was dreamin' when you said you love me
The start of nothin'
Had no chance to prepare, couldn't see you comin'
And we started from nothin'
Ooh, I could hate you now
It's alright to hate me now
We both know that deep down
The feeling still deep down is good

There were things you didn't need to say, did you mean to? Mean to?

Then fall in the dirt to feed the crows
They'll rip apart his flesh
'Til all that's left is glorious bone
So you'll bury your own

And you claimed all you could hold
Until death did you part from the mess you made

I bet your mother would be proud of you

To survive and thrive in the jungle
Maybe hearts were made to pump blood
Maybe lungs were made for flood

Higgs,Frank Ocean,Endless,"{'year': 2016, 'month': 8, 'day': 19}","Saturdays involved making our entrances into life outside
We've been in this room too long
Recreation is keeping us selfcontained and aware
Of each other's forms still and in full strides
Just the same
Keeping us warm
Walking in straight lines
Talking to sleep at night
Coddled and pacified
By versions of mothers

It's all new to me
It's all new to me
Having you around
It's all new to me
It's all new to me
Having you 'round the Higgs

What if we decide to live by choice?
All this time I knew
That average was something to fall back on after genius ends
I watch video; only difference is flattened and remiss
Sparks of lightning storm behind wet faces
Slipped my pants back on and rewind it backward more
The tape stopped before I was back alone

I'll be back before
The street lights on, before the daylight's gone
I was spoiled by lavish thoughts
They don't compare, no, not at all
And had this been the past I might not know
What to do with all
Of what you showed
What you give, my words can't hold
And if acts of God breaks us apart
Least we did ours

'Cause my dad don't clock off 'til late

And I'ma give you chills, harmonizing to Otis, Isley, Marvin

Get so paranoid
I ain't see nothing…
I used to play tough with the cops, had ideas
Told my girl who protest hold me a spot, and I'll go
Black folk know what talking white means, but still
Hold two open hands up in the sky, finger quotes
In my gangly youth my limbs used to swing like Polo tees
Mazal tov, still pop a bottle like what Puff did Steve
If you can't tote your own weight then what's this buff shit even bout?
Crystals in your lil' feet, that's all that dust protein
Swoop Tremaine from Calabasas in a Brit sports car
We used to cypher in Marc Jacobs, had the library card
At Scott's comparing the silver spoons to plastic knives and sporks
I was the dog breathless chasing the car up the street
If I ever catch it I'll panic, that's the flaw in me
Nothing glamorous about growing up poor and naïve
Standing on the balls of my feet, trying to pray before I sleep

Selling like red light pussy
Gotta waterfall douche it
Level head on the cushion
Light pink I'm revving
Light green, I'm someone like you, someone like me
Ring finger might sure get tooken
Wrist like springs, natural springs, water green indoor cookie
Other than me and you, ain't nobody else coming between, the glue stuck
We got the camera on Monday
We made a movie on Tuesday, fuck
We got the look, get looks
They never seen stars, the city too bright
Bright, bright, bright, bright

I try to sleep, can't get a lot
Make dreams bleed into days
The pressure couldn't stop
The bleeding I started seeing things
Watching out for demons
Blocked him like a screen, these plays
I was always reading, yeah
Then some hair grew where the sun don't shine
And I started feeling like pussy popping was the paradigm
Getting my dick wet, maritime
Lying on my virgin, Jergens moisturized
Gee whiz, gee whiz, gee whiz
All my friends is so, No homo”
Blaze to trail behind
No heroes in front of mind
Just rappers who'd evolve with time
Looked up to them, knew all the rhymes
But at that time they enforced a bias
You know like some cops stop and frisk a guy
Cause he's brown, so of course he sides
With all the gangs these lames is extorted by
Switch lanes in the Porsche I drive
Let the police Ford Explorer by
Sirens screaming like they four or five
Throwing tantrums on the 
Still on the whey like I'm tryna gain
Don't hibernate in the winter, that's where summer bodies are made
Just leg days like a sprinter
With the Bryan Baby blue interior
Big B's like GMO's
And they sting when my eyes close
All I see when my eyes close
Blame my emo on time zones
It's the same but different
Sets, twin siblings, head spinning
Exorcist

Speaking of God, at ten years old, I switched church homes
The bishop was tweaking, and we was Baptist
So how you a bishop? Like technically speaking
You drove a white Rolls, me and my family was type broke
The difference between having a home and not having a home was a tightrope
Visiting Catholic Churches, the masses was quiet as mice so
The minister spoke with no microphone
They had no choir, so silent I thought I heard Christ go
'You need a messiah'
Ran out the house from hormones, you seven months pregnant with Ryan
I figured I'd go to the East by my T for some peace and quiet
I ended up running the streets with my cousins, sitting in the back
Listening to beats, scheming on schemes that came to pass
They strategy murder yourselves, don't fall according to stats
I pray the new plots clear and thick as bulletproof glass
Cause the worst part of death is ambitions are dashed
Keep speaking death, it'll start to seem like the new car you wanna buy
It starts popping up on your way to work, see it all the time, always passing by
Call it playing Beetlebug, yeah, it's on sight, better throw a punch
Running late to Teterboro, made the plane wait because it's no rush
Clouds floating over oceans from above

"Godspeed Screenplay (Episode 1, Scene 1)",Frank Ocean,Boys Don’t Cry (Magazine),"{'year': 2016, 'month': 8, 'day': 20}","The city feels simultaneously old and new, weathered by time and progress, lending it a distinctive quality. A modern city embracing technology but somewhat overtaken by nature, still trying to find a balance. There are pickups and wagons amongst the luxury cars, very democratic. Steely peers into a car with a cigarette in the ashtray. Using the metallic card, he swipes it against the cars access strip and gains entry. He steals the cig, lights it and walks a few cars down. He notices a hanging air freshener in another car and decides he likes it, breaks into that car as well taking the fragrant contraband. The stillness is mesmerizing, you can barely hear the autobahn in the distance or the steps of his companion just a few feet ahead.
Caged court centered in a park somewhat densely populated with live oak trees, their limbs perfectly frame rather than reach above the court. Clark is around ’” or ”, lean but strapping and towering compared to a seemingly younger Steely who just beamed a ball at Clark and nearly landed a punch before Robb and Matthew bodyblocked.  Clark would have hurt him, badly, obviously, as Steely is a few years younger and developing a physique to match his mental toughness.
     Robb: Whoa whoa whoa level down…’
     Matthew: Kiss and make up, friends. Its a contact sport.’
     Steely: Nah, miss me with that, he always tryna big man somebody.’
     Clark: Checks his face for blood. Spits.) Game point.’
Steely steps up to guard him, placing his hand on Clarks side to telegraph his movements. Clark crosses him, drives and lays the ball up, winning the game.
     Clark: Whoo! RIC FLAIR voice) Did you feel that? Did you sense the sublime finesse and technique just then? You should be grateful. You should be grateful for me. Here.’
     Steely: Blah, blah, blah.’ Shrugs and mimes, picks the dead basketball up off the ground and does a tricky slam dunk with excess energy.)
The quiet of the morning scene continues, Steely and Shoobie continue walking as if in a dream. No birds, no other people, no sounds of cars. You see cars though, and you can hear a faint wind occasionally disrupt the silence as it passes between the rubber of the vehicles and the concrete. The skyline is a blended ecosystem of the natural world and school buildings. Tall structures of glass, steel, brick and mortar raised on stilts of a hard clear substance. Limbs of trees reaching out through some windows, you see entire floors made into greenhouses and pocket jungles sprawling off rooftops. They approach a park where we see a sculpture of a child hanging from the sky from a string that goes up forever, touching the surface of a never ending rippling pond below with the tip of his finger. There are no paths of stone or concrete, the grounds are riddled with ever so slight inclines and valleys. Theres a large Olympic sized pool built with Carrara marble, students ice skate it during the winter and skateboard in it in warmer months.
Shoobie walks slowly ahead of Steely, carrying a slate of metal, head held high, inhaling deeply and gratefully from a harmless, flavored steam cigarette. She squints her large eyes eyes on a toke and looks back at Steely going inside of someone elses car.  The colors of her eyes change. She keeps walking. Steely catches up and throws his arm around Shoobie — he quickly takes his arm back to himself then grabs both her elbows and turns her toward him.
     Shoobie: Bobbing her head to music that isn't playing, she sings) 'That's the way everyday goes, every time we've no control...'
Steely looks up at the sky. A wide, flat translucent aircraft is coasting slowly above, leaving clouds in its wake and filtering sunlight into beautiful prismatic refractions onto him.
He's looking down at Shoobie, she's wearing radiation protective gear. Her helmet is mirrored orange and red, the suit has a white body. He focuses on her and not the campus being destroyed behind her by fire.
     Steely: Is death a high? I heard its like DMT. The guy who told me that isnt dead. Maybe its worth dying. The high I mean. Worst part about it though. We wont remember being so tight you know? Look at us!’
Brushes imaginary locks from his face)
     Shoobie: ‘..uhh?’
Steely looks down at his feet and theres ice on the grass though its summer. Steely pulls his head up to say snow’ but doesnt even make the begining sounds of the word. A single ball of alloy, white encoded with ice, spins around them like a tether ball to its pole. Shoobie still mouthing the words to a song playing in her head. If you could fly then youd feel south, up norths gettin’ cold soonThe way it is were on land — still im someone to hold true’."

Together,Frank Ocean,"Lonny Breaux, Pt. 2","{'year': 2011, 'month': 4, 'day': 7}","Oh, were in this together
Have a little faith
Oh, you ought to know who you are
Oh, were all children
Were all human, were all breathing
Were all needing, more than what they're giving
Cant you feel it?
The space of whats missing

You look up and they tell you its a godless sky, a godless sky
So you look down
Cause youve convinced yourself
That this is all youve got, all youve got

But picture four billion hearts beating with yours, with ours
Picture four billion faces held high for love
If theres one thing about this world I know
Its that were in it, together
Youre not alone, Im not alone
If theres one thing about this world I know
Were together, were together

I love you
And I dont know you
But I know the light in you
Is the same as in me
I trust you, like a brother
Cause who could understand the pain
Better than someone whos going through it

You look up and they tell you its a godless sky, a godless sky
But dont you look down
Dont you convince yourself
That this is all youve got, all youve got

Just picture four billion hearts beating with you, with ours
Picture four billion faces held high for love
If theres one thing about this world I know
Its that were in it, together
Youre not alone, Im not alone
If theres one thing about this world I know
Were together

Ive searched the souls of my people
For something to believe in
Oh, not words that I could say
But I heard them, I heard them

Just picture four billion hearts beating with you, with ours
Picture four billion faces held high for love
If theres one thing about this world I know
Its that were in it, together
Youre not alone, Im not alone
If theres one thing about this world I know

"Godspeed Screenplay (Episode 1, Scene 3)",Frank Ocean,Boys Don’t Cry (Magazine),"{'year': 2016, 'month': 8, 'day': 20}","In one class, a smooth but occasionally glitchy D projection of a teacher greets Steely. The teacher is severe in appearance and manner. Though her projection corresponds to a live human being somewhere else on the planet, she might as well be a robot or at least the ghost of a human once capable of warm emotion.
     Teacher: 'Punctuality appears to be your Achilles' heel, Mr. Grude. Alas, you've cleared H, admirable. Quiet your ears, then solve the riddle.'
The teacher trails away.
Steely exhales loudly. Takes his bag off and hangs it on a hook. There is a digital hour clock in the top left corner, it's black steel with white numbers. The walls are covered in floral wallpaper, overhead there's a clear paneled mechanical ceiling. The mahogany floors ramp up to class seating, with curves and layers dynamically represented. A wall for projection wrapped in a semi circle lies at the head of the class.
Steely breathes in deeply, dropping his shoulders. The room is so quiet. He closes his eyes. A montage flashing in his head: Shoobie's mouth, himself as a small boy calling up from a pit, fencing, climbing a fence, running. A small quiet click comes into his ears from a clock. The memory of his father first forgetting while giving a lecture at his school. The silence. The stutter. The angry burst at someone touching his arm. He remembers his father not remembering him. His mother throwing things out of focus. The canopied street. The first car he stole on a spinning platter. His father's car.
Steely is mumbling a mantra and slowly his memories whitewash away. He opens his eyes and he is seated on a chair in full lotus. He breaks position and pulls a tray out of a side compartment and now he has a surface with a bowl in its center, a few gauges and a small loupe. It's what seems to be a mini solar system that he's manipulating with the gauges.
The teacher swarms back in and places a decadesold transparency paper on a projector.
The riddle:
     Teacher: 'You poured it hot and you're stirring it up, now what's moving faster, the tea or the cup?'
     Steely: 'The tea.'
     Teacher: What's harder Mr. Grude, a liquid or a solid?'
     Steely: 'Shit'
     Teacher: 'Of course. And what does your understanding of physics inform you of as it relates to softness and hardness of matter, Mr. Grude?'
     Steely: 'That, from a subatomic perspective, my shit is composed of particles mostly vibrating at a higher rate than my piss.'
     Teacher: 'Thank you, Mr. Grude. Your deft articulation leaves little to the imagination.'
     Steely: 'You don't have an imagination.'
     Teacher: 'Well, congratulations Mr. Grude. It has been my pleasure watering yours.'
The teacher swarms off. A status bar appears on the projection wall as if loading something. When full, a dozen other desks appear next to Steely each with a student projection seated in them, creating trails with their movements. These projections seem almost real. Unlike the microcosm whose projections are light based, the students' apparitions are hard particle nano projections whose touch have a light weight, thus they can interact with the physical world on a low level. The teacher rematerializes.
     Teacher: 'Grad students, the last movie of your lives here. Giant""—. Enjoy.'
Steely looks down at his desk. His microcosm is developing well, thriving. There are  life harboring planets in his system. He looks through his scope. He monitors his gauges, adjusting tension and gravity here and there.
Steely receives a tummy rub via instant messaging from Shoobie, and a pouty face. He replies with a blush face. The movie plays and a couple of the students are watching. The class is / male to female. A swirl of different races and creeds. Someone's nose starts bleeding. A Japanese student crinkles plastic in a Russian girl's ear to annoy her. Two students are reading palms. Steely extends his hand, taps a blue eyed Korean kid named Kio.
     Steely: 'Howdy'
     Kio: 'Listen. It's out of control. My parents are hiring a load of lifeguards for this weekend. Apparently someone drowned last year at the pool party I've never had. Been on my Kegel exercises since last week.
Kio's projection spreads hair on Steely's scalp with his swarm fingers and examines it before Steely shakes him away)
     Kio: 'Your hair is so clean?'
     Steely: 'Kioget off.' Doesn't move. Focuses his sight through the scope down into the microcosm.)
     Kio: Speaking out loud) 'Western hygiene has lacked as fuckthese guys look dank.'
     Blonde Girl: 'Close your mouth!'
     Kio: 'Only if you keep yours open.'
     Blonde Girl: You're small.'
     Kio: 'She didn't talk to me like this last night. I'm so confused. This sucks.'
     Blonde Girl: 'Do you know I can hear you? What was last night? I'm in Morocco.'
     Kio: 'Last night, last monthwhenever this loud sex was. I forget.' Kio turns his head and is punched in the nose by Blonde's swarm hand.)
     Blonde Girl: Warns) 'You are a small feeling. Do not!'
The downpour outside intensifies.
     Steely: 'She didn't like that one, Kio.'
     Kio: 'Bro, whatever, she's a lunatic, and she just got herself uninvited.'
     Steely: Laughs and shakes his head.)
Dree, the Pacific islander student, taps Steely.
     Steely: 'That's TWO cartridges.'
     Dree: Says 'okay' without saying anything.)
It thunders soon after a grand flash of lightning. Rain comes down heavier and heavier, then a black out.
The D swarms of students and teacher disappear and the room goes dark. The glow of Steely's experiment is the only light source in the room. His gaze stays stuck on the system, its glow upon his face. Just then a message notice activates.
GROUP TEXT:
     Matthew: 'Anybody seen Robb? I think we lost Robb black ass.'
     Robb: A piece of me with always be inside of you.'
     Shoobie: 'lol' emoticon)
Steely gets up from his desk, pulls his hoody over hid head and goes to use the urinals outside in the storm.
It's pouring as he walks toward a small shallow tower of urinalsthey resemble a merrygoround. He pisses with the rain falling on him hard. No one is outside. He washes his hands on a faucet above the urinal then heads back toward his class. Sunlight cuts through the rain. He gets back to his seat, soaked, and sits down in the naturally lit room. He looks down at his bowl for a moment, lights a cigarette and stares at it for a moment. Spinning it around and staring at the ember trails. The sunlight creates streaks across the classroom through the ceiling. He pushes everything back into a single point then folds the desktop back into the compartment.
Steely's eyes well up."

This time
We got permission
Nothing's above condition
But this ain't a thang
It's a mission
Can't join the band so sing along
Me and my boyfriend got it going on
Sleep with fans and t shirts on
Asleep in vans your legs all strewn
Across my lap
Tan lines where your watch was strapped
You took off to make time
Cut your hair
You left it so long
I love to stare
There's nothing wrong
And if I die while I'm asleep
I pray to God my boyfriend
Keeps my secret

And I think you made for the life I lead
I'm not fake patient, I don't fake sick, huh
That kinda coffin don't need lean
Rest in peace
Got this lust for life in me, yeah
Horny for the game, uh
First they kiss, then they bite soft, uh
Then that bitch wanna play it off, huh
Fuck it, I'm pretty still in a pit of snakes
While serpents shake some brand new scales
I need a new face, I'm tired of these weirdos
Acting familiar, took all the rock
And turned it to pop, he think that he Elvis
And he ungrateful, they don't say thank you
They don't say grace, not even for meals, not even for millions
Fuck it, I'm pretty still, look at my deal
Richard Mille, look at my ears, flooded with diamonds
Look at my skills, running through blocks like ers
Fortynine diamonds, stuffed in my bracelet
That cost a whop, that cost a whopper
And it ain't new, I had a knot at John Ehret in my locker
Pretty still, it ain't no pretty pill
It's either real or real
Real easy on the eyes, green like a soccer field
Skin hot when they tried me like them poppers feel
Hands shaking, norepinephrine levels skyrocket, fuel
Rocket

Quit being violent with me
Quit being violent with me
Quit being violent with me
You make me violent

Every night you were in my room
My room, my room with me
I guess I can't state my feelings too soon
I don't know you
And I can't put no threats in the air

Uhh, uh, what
I gotta leave you be, every night you iggin' me
Boy, baby, get your life right, baby, message me
And I hit you back, fast, Mackin', like in Tennessee
Off in my room, doin' what I ain't supposed to be
Wet sheets my sex be, I speak so messy
Babe pass me that death tree and let me smoke please
At night you be in my room, don't care what city
You dyin' to catch my seed, take off and reunite
Don't freak like you desperate, shout out your exes
They dealt with your selfish type of aggression
I beat then I flexed it, that's my confession
I skeet just to exit off to your best friend
Don't take this hard, me pretty boy, how I exit
You dread a thought, I made your heart an investment
We creep 'cause you pressed it, that ass a weapon
No sleep on that bed spread, you get this message

"Godspeed Screenplay (Episode 1, Scene 2)",Frank Ocean,Boys Don’t Cry (Magazine),"{'year': 2016, 'month': 8, 'day': 20}","The hardwood hallway extends into a room where Shoobie is seated in front of a white desk with a translucent top that is eventually lit from beneath. Shes sketching schematics with graphite while D printing small pieces of the design from the sketch paper directly. Steely places the cereal on her table and sits on a fullsized bed cornered against the far left wall. Steely eats and looks around the room. Photos and schematics are placed on the wall, bed sheets spill onto the floor and Shoobies wearing PE shorts, varsity hoodie, ankle socks and a messy ponytail. Its a perfectly livedin moment that feels right in the ways youd hope for when two people comfortably cohabitate. Just then he noticed a message in his field of vision.
BEGIN TEXT:
     Matthew:  wya? wyd?’
     Steely:  Im here man. breakfast.’
     Matthew:  ole oatmeal eatin’ ass boy’
     Danny:  all star suck me ups last night’
Steely: who?’
     Danny:  imma bring her and her friend out to the water.’
     Steely:  oh, OK.’
     Mathew: about to shower---’
     Steely::Yea, I gotta do the same rn.’
Steely puts the phone down and finishes his bowl of oatmeal. Shoobies cereal sits untouched where he placed it, getting soggy.
Steely returns to the kitchen, puts the bowl in a light wash rack. He pulls on a shallow drawer and grabs a refrigerated metal slate from a stack of four. The slate responds to his touch, turning transparent while a swarm of light particles activate a D projection an inch off its surface, making a mold of his hand. Steely places his hand into the particle mold then gets up and walks into the bathroom down the hall, to the right, then left of two bathrooms. Steely sits on the toilet and begins to masturbate to a video now playing on the slate. The ground changes hue.
Theres a signal that class is about to begin.
     Shoobie: Im going to class.’
     Steely: Should go together.’
     Shoobie: Yea – what about yours?’
     Steely: I wasnt going to go in there till later.’
     Shoobie: Irrational fears again?
     Steely: Naw…’
     Shoobie: They wont let you come into class late…’ Steely cuts her off)
     Steely: I know.’
     Shoobie: Truant.’ Stares him down)
They kiss. Steely leans into it a bit and reaches under her skirt. Students are watching them. She punches him playfully in the chest and he backs off. Steely leaves Shoobie standing there, while he disappears down a decline, through a grove of trees.
Steely arrives at the entrance to a gated community, as behind him a bullet train hydroplanes silently along a narrow band of water. He lights a flavored cigarette, drops it on the ground by accident and picks it up, he puffs it to keep it alive as he walks towards a guard post. As he approaches, a woman in her fifties hangs her head out of the doorway of the security quarters. Her name is Florence and its apparent she knows Steely.
Florence works multiple locations as a security guard and as Steely has developed his hobby of breaking into cars, hes also developed a relationship with Florence. She suspects what he does but looks the other way, treating him as a favorite aunt would. She has a soft spot for him and occasionally Steely brings her cigarettes or coffee or a flower picked up along the way.
There are two mesh steel hates. In front of the gates are a row of solid metal cylindrical posts that swivel up and down into the ground.
     Florence: Cmon child.’ Lazily)
Steely speeds up to a slight jog up to her half doorhalf window.
     Steely: Yes, maam,’
     Florence: Put that out.’
     Steely: Yes, maam,’
     Florence: Im proud of you. You know that, dont you?’
     Steely: Yes, maam,’
     Florence: Give me a square, son.’
Steely goes in his parka pocket and hands two to the woman – she puts one to her mouth and lights it.
     Florence:  Mmmhmm, go head on.’ Turns an eye without turning her head.)
The gates clear, the posts lower.
Steely walks through the gates and down many stairs. Before exiting the stair well he stops to read a series of text messages from various senders.
BEGIN TEXT:
     Mia: Another thought on perfection. The only problem with her is that she is too perfect. She is bad in a way that entices, and good in a way that comforts. She is mischief but then she is the warmth of home. The dreams of the wild and dangerous but the memories of childhood and gladness. She is perfection. And when given something perfect, it is the nature of man to dedicate his mind to finding something wrong with it and then when he is able to find something wrong with it, he rejoices in his find, and sees only the flaw, becoming blind to everything else! And this is why man is never given anything that is perfect, because when given the imperfect and the ugly, man will dedicate his mind to finding what is good with the imperfect and upon finding one good thing with the extremely flawed, he will only see the one good thing, and no longer see everything else that is ugly. And so..man complains to God for having less than what he wants..but this is the only thing that man can handle. Man cannot handle what is perfect. It is the nature. It is the nature of the mortal to rejoice over the one thing that he can proudly say that he found on his own, with no help from another, whether it be a shadow in a perfect diamond, or a faint beautiful reflection in an extremely dull mirror.
     Steely: Sorry, I hope you feel better.’
NEXT TEXT:
     Steely: Youre not athletic.’
     Clark: We could line it up.’
     Steely: You week, haha.’
NEXT TEXTS, STEELY READS BUT DOESNT RESPOND:
     Unknown contact: Have a day you dreamed of.’
     Andree Pacific islander): One more pak and Ill drop it.’
     Kio: BITCHES LOVE YOU.’
NEXT TEXT:
     Shoobie: Who r u with rn?’
     Steely: No one :/’
     Shoobie: Matthews house? bored. misu.’
He finishes his correspondence and continues on. The stairwell opens to a strip where two wide roads sit, parallel but not separate. The lefthand road leads to a Cape Cod  style country club and what looks like a beach. Near the country club, a split in the main road leads to another wide, twoway road where the opposite directions are paved at different heights, like a shelf. Theres a black sand beach on one side and mature manicured hedges on the other; the tops of homes are visible. Steely walks down the road and as he passes a second block, the road narrows and inclines to a cavernous walkway that winds through the greater community.
A guys with a long curly afro, wearing a white hooded jacket with M accents, shorts, waist weights, and Nike running shoes comes out of a property. He jogs in place and does some light stretches. Steely walks up to the guy who turns out to be his friend Matthew, while casually running his fingers across the hedges. The two of them wave low and perfunctorily at each other then cross paths. Though theres acknowledgement, it seems a bit clandestine as if theyre about to set something in motion.
Matthew jogs downhill with his arms outstretched and banks right into a still narrower canopied alley. Steely stays in place and keeps time. Matthew is now jogging perfectly center though a lane with mesh steel garage door every  years. He picks up the pace in his jog as you see the garage door open ten yards ahead – a white singleseater begins to speed out the garage but manages to stop right before hitting Matthew. Matthew acts startled.
     Matthew:  Yelling at the Garten, and slamming his hands on the hood) DAMN – NICE BREAKS!’
Matthew then jogs on following the car as it speeds in a straight line away from the scene till its no longer visible. Matthew hits a corner, makes a right and meets Steely back in front of Matthews house. They walk inside the yard gate through hedges and past fountains down a ramp into a cave like living space with an unobstructed view of the ocean.
They pass cleaning staff and art leaning up against the walls. Outside the window you can see where his yard slopes down to the ocean side cliff. Theres a pool with a high dive, a solarium, a lone, odd colored dog sits gazing at them as they walk through the house and towards Matthews bedroom. Matthew changes clothes quickly as Steely is talking to him about weed.
     Matthew:  Fronto leaves?? – You act like you discovered fire.’
     Steely:  You ever catch Mr. and Mrs. Hagen intimate – in their moment. Id bet you havent, because theyre stuck with you. How free will they be when youre out on your own? Theres a place for you in this world bro and Im your friend, ok?’
     Matthew:  Youre acting out now, you can stop.’
     Steely:  Mrs. Hagen Im sure is still very agile on that horse.’
     Matthew:  You want some water or something?’
     Steely:  Yea. Do you dance still. You used to be a good dancer. Walks away to kitchen)
     Matthew:  Pour my shake out the blender!’
     Steely:  Calling out from kitchen) Nah, you dont have any ice!’
     Matthew:  Calling out from bedroom) Who the fuck said anything about ice?!’’
     Steely:  Sorry, you know I really appreciate you buddy. I couldnt find anything quite right for Shoobies birthday – everythings so generic to her, she just scans it with her computer eyes.’
Steely walks into the bedroom again, Matthew is ready to leave. Steely hands him a shake and eats small pieces of fruit while finishing a blue can of Coke. The two of them exit Matthews room into an area where nothing else is in the shot apart from a righthand drive Nissan Skyline from a hundred years ago and a small orange groove. Steely relights the fronto leaf blunt.
     Matthew:  Put the fronto out. Drive.’
Later on the drive.
     Steely:  I cant think its too many notes.’
     Steely:  Hes not on the  yet. Thats impossible.’
     Matthew:  People are fucked.’
     Steely:  Hes taking his time. How did he look when you ran into him?’
     Matthew:  People are so fucked… Uhh, yea – he looked really happy to see me.’
     Steely:  What are you talking..cuts himself off)? Why are people fucked? That include you or nah?’
     Matthew: People are just bad, like, toward other people. I should quit giving this traffic..but I cant.’
     Steely:  You gonna tell me something I dont know?’ Says this with the look on his face and not words.)
     Matthew:  I showed you this already, but watch again.’ Handing Steely his phone to watch something.
     Matthew:  When the lady gets sent to the neighbors house by her uncle to fight someone and she ends up running and getting chased, then falls down, breaks her shit and they set her on fire..’
     Steely:  Yea, that hurt my feelings. She seemed to confident.’
     Steely:  Did you listen to that Goye thing I told you about?’
     Matthew:  Yeah. Are those lights new?’ Looking at lights that follow the highway railing.)
Topography blurred outside the vehicle grass – suburbia and city overlapping – hyper color – non specific.
Matthew pulls into a sprawling office campus. We see a network of buildings, there are people from the company walking about engaged in conversation. One group in particular is huddled and highlighted.
     Colleague #:  Exploded?!’
     Colleague #:  Without heat?’
     Colleague #:  Yeah, or human shrapnel.’
     Colleague #:  So absent of heat, absence of residual bio and absent of our guy.’
     Colleague #:  Hes jumped on grenades before and lived.’
     Colleague #:  Chemiluminescence isnt the mark of a grenade.’
     Colleague #:  Maybe saving the world a few times makes you eligible for dharmic ascension?’
Office campus is a CAR FREE IS A CAREFREE’ zone – there is offsite parking for commuters.
Matthews car is stopped. They trade places at the wheel and Steely gets out. He walks towards the outskirts of the office campus. Matthew tries to pull unto the parking structure which is multilevel and underground. He begins to argue with the security person manning the entrance.
     Matthew:  Why are you telling me I cant park here?? Its a free world.’
     Parking Security:  Credentials please, sir? Sir. Sir. This is a corporate facility, credentials please.’
     Matthew:  Whats the corporate ever done for me?! Huh? Since you know every God damn thing. What they done?? I should sit down right here and take a hot shit in the facilities.’
Steely walks down the ramp into the structure casually, trying not to be noticed – the distracted guard notices and chases after him shouting about credentials. Steely breaks into a sprint. Seconds later a small low flying autonomous aircraft is heard in pursuit of Steely down the structure.  Steely spots Gartens car, the one that almost hit Matthew earlier, slides over the tip of it and almost falls of the edge of the parking structure which cascades into a waterfall, leading down into channels below street level.
Steely regains his balance and struggles with his car boosting key card, trying to gain access to Gartens car. It isnt letting him into the car and he begins to panic, but finally it clicks on – you can hear the whistle and the buzz of the security drone flying towards him. He slides down the seat so as not to be visible from the window. The drone flies to the edge of the parking structure and hovers, observing downward as the water flows. It then turns around and heads back to continue its search elsewhere. Just then Steely feels the vibration of an incoming message.
BEGIN TEXT:
     Unknown contact:  Chase the rabbit three ways down, a ways to go.’
Steely:  Whos there?’
     Unknown contact:  Do you have time?’
Steelys baffled by the text but doesnt have time to dwell on it, he starts the car and begins looking for another spot to park it, far enough from the original spot so as not to be noticed but still within the same parking structure. The perfect spot is three levels down. He carefully exits the car, makes his way into a common walkway towards a lift, gets inside though its crammed with people, and squeezes in amongst the plainclothed engineers and corp. Employees all talking in code and oblivious to Steely.
Elevator doors open. Above ground its raining. Everyone braces for the rain as they exit. Steely puts his hood on and walks into an overpass. Billboards tower above it showing blue skies, a beach scene and a slogan that reads: Its June in Miami”. The rain continues pouring down, hes still in the thick of the crowd. Steely exits down a ramp, jumps over a shallow ledge, walks under an overpass – theres traffic speeding past him blurred – and begins to wait. Matthew pulls his car over, shining his lights on Steely. Steely gets into the car and steals the cigarette Matthew just lit from his mouth. Cars speed past going under and over intersections. A song played."
Standing Still,Frank Ocean,"Lonny Breaux, Pt. 2","{'year': 2011, 'month': 4, 'day': 7}","I'm standing by your locker
In the hallway after class
Swear I'm amazed, yeah
The drawing in my binder
Every picture I put a halo on your head

I'm on waiting on my angel
My first love
My first kiss
My second, my third
The one my momma like so much

I'm standing, still fucking waiting
I'm standing, still 'til you're with me
As the time flies faster baby
You could fly, fly faster baby
I'm standing, standing still
I'm standing still, standing still
Oh, standing still

Saturdays I'm at the snow cone spot
Trying to guess your favorite flavor
I'm thinking cotton candy, maybe
I bought it and I placed it on the table next to me
I wish you could taste it
Cause it's surely melting

I'm on waiting on my angel
My first love
My first kiss
My second, my third
The one my momma like so much

While the rain storm takes over, outrageous baby
I'll be standing here, seconds forward
I'll take it later, I'll be right there
Oh no, matter what I'll be here
However long

This Is Mom,Frank Ocean,Boys Don’t Cry (Magazine),"{'year': 2016, 'month': 8, 'day': 20}","With Lonny,” Rosie recalls, he had that drive towards being successful. And certainly, they spent enough time in Sydneys studio to make a lot good music together, and they did. I was a lot more worried about Tyler. I remember chasing him around the house saying Tyler, I think youre crazy, I think theres something seriously wrong with you.’ And I remember Lonny was there and said, Auntie Rosie, let me get this clip!’ I said, You better not!’” She laughs. I had curlers all in my hair. And he wanted to get this on film!”
With a big heart and warm personality, Rosies quick to take others on as her own, and give Frank the same maternal care and advice that Jonathan reaps, as heard on Not Just Money,” an interlude on channel ORANGE. She also has a particular flair for voicemails: She makes another guest appearance on the new album, with a voicemail that warns of flesheating bacteria thats roaming rampant on college campuses.
Sat in an IHOP where the waitress knows how she takes her coffee extra hot for the first cup), Rosie comes here often to study, currently in graduate school for Psychology and Therapy. Though she can chat for days, shes an equally good listener, and an acute observer, the result of  years working as a probationparole officer in Los Angeles. Dressed superfly, with a sharp sense of style due to her daily routine she calls prep before you primp”) Rosie brings us into her world and tells it how it is.
Interviewer: How did Frank and Jonathan meet?
Rosie: They met through Eddie and Raymond, they are also my nephews. And then Jonathan introduced Lonny to Sydney. Thats how they came together, musically and creatively. They would meet at Sydneys house in high school, and they would compose music. And they just loved it; they just had a wonderful time. And I stayed on Lonny: Lonny, get my son home by curfew!” I made him give me his cell phone number, and I would fuss at him. I kept him running for sure.
Interviewer: Your voicemails are stuff of legends. What do you love about leaving people messages?
Rosie: I think when you call someone, you should leave a voicemail for them. But with my son, I do leave voicemails for him, Ill often leave inspirational voicemails. Sometimes I leave nasty voicemails too! And Ill leave nasty voicemails for Lonny too, when the timing is right! I want them to always remember to just be themselves, they dont have to be the type of man described in a rap song. They dont have to be balling, they dont have to be ballers, they dont have to be shot callers. I leave voicemails for my son in particular because I want my son to remain optimistic. I want him to know that his mother has his back, no matter what. I want Lonny to also know that Auntie Rosie is here for him.
Interviewer: Whats the last advice you gave to Frank?
Rosie: When I last saw him, he came by the house, and he was in this beautiful… Porsche I think it was? Sedan? It was gorgeous. And I said, Remember in life, you have to have both swagger and sway. With swagger alone, youre convincing yourself that you have something that you really may not have, and that others dont see in you. sway is knowing what to do with that swagger. Sway is influence. Its persuasion, and I shortened it to sway. You have to believe in yourself, but you also have to impart that confidence in such a way that you convince other people to believe in you, and take a chance on you. In life, youve got to have both swagger and sway. Remember that.’ He laughed and said, Okay Auntie, Ill remember that.’ And I said, By the way I am going to trademark that statement! Its a Rosie original.’
Interviewer: Are you into cars as well?
Rosie: I really do love cars. I drive a  Chevy HHR, and I love that little care. Thats the longest Ive ever kept a car. Normally I would keep a car for only two years, because I love different cars. Although now I have a KIA Optima, which Id bought for my son to drive when he was in college. KIA and Hyundai are sister companies, and I find they make very good vehicles. As a matter of fact, the car that Rodney King, black in , outran the police in was a Hyundai. Imaginethis funnylooking black man, in this this funny sounding car, outruns the police. You know that made them angry! So even then in , the Hyundai was a very good car. It was very fast. I love cars. I have to wash and vacuum my car every week, because somehow I see the car as an extension of me. They seem to drive better when theyre clean! There was a commercialI believe it was for Cadillacand it said when you turn your car on it should do the same for you.” I also owned a Cadillac, an Escalade, several years ago. And my motto was: When you in a Cadillac, you know where you in a Cadillac, you know where youre at.” Theyre wonderful cars.
Interviewer: What was your favorite ever car?
Rosie: I would say my Chevy Camero. I was younger of course, it was red, it was fast. Of course, I appreciate the Pinto that my mother made my sister hand down to me, I think it was a ‘ Pinto. But the Camero was the car that I bought for myself; it was my first brandnew car. And it lasted: I had over , miles on that car.
Interviewer: What are your thoughts on social media and the younger generation?
Rosie: I do believe that they are, in many ways, in a good place. I believe that social media is a medium by which they do communicate with one another, and also become activists in many ways. It truly is an opportunity for activism. However, I also do believe that it can also be very destructive in the sense that it can derail their focus. Forms of social media are potentially very addictive. And they can consume too much of your time to the point that you are too concerned with what other people think about you. I do believe that people that use it have to know how to use it, and hot to limit its use.
Sometimes Id hear my son laughing in his room, so Id walk in his room and say, Whats so funny? What are you laughing about?” And he would say, Mom, Im talking to my friends.” And Id say, Youre not talking to your friends, you are typing to them.” I would go and get the house phone and bring it to him and say, Here. Call them. Hear their voices.” I also told him this: Do not ever ask a girl for a date through text.” If a guy ever asked me for a date on a text, I would probably text back something very unkind, with an exclamation point!
Interviewer: Do you use social media yourself?
Rosie: I dont know how to Tweet. No, let me say thisI sent a tweet a couple of years ago, maybe a year and a half ago, to MC Hammer. Somehow I got a tweet from MC Hammer, and I tweeted back to him somehow in my reply! That was my one and only time. He had been arrested by the policeit was profiling. I said to MC Hammer, Remember this. The lesson thats to be learned is the police officers lesson to learn. It is his lesson to learn that not all black men are thugs, and that you cant judge a book by its cover.” Actually theres one thing Id like to be able to use social media for! With Micheal Brown having been killed in Ferguson Missouri, theres one tweet I would love to send out. I believe that this jury is not going to come back with an indictment of Darren Wilson. I believe that so much time is elapsing now over this entire case, I believe theres a lot of corruption going on in the investigation of this case. One Tweet I would like to hear the crowd shout out is: We know about the wait, theyre getting their lives straight!” I would love to have someone tweet it for me and say, Auntie Rosie said that you all need to shout this out!” I believe that they are delaying the investigation of this case because theyre getting the stories straight. Sowe know about the wait, theyre getting their lies straight. Although Im a peace officer myself, I believe that we have to respect people, we have to be respectful to their rights, we cannot become so intoxicated with our own power that we in fact think that we own the world and we run it, and everyone else is just a guest. We have to stay in our place too; we have to stay in our lane.
Interviewer: Whats some advice youd give someone reading this magazine>
Rosie: Dont confuse stability with stagnation. In life, you want to move towards stability. The stability is what you want in your family life, its what you want in your job and career. Dont look for excitement in everything you do; we have to be able to live and contend with boredom. But that doesnt mean that youre stagnated. Remain inspired throughout life, curious, moving forward. We should not be afraid to risk, to take a risk. We should have courage.
Interviewer: Whats the best advice someone gave you?
Rosie: I remember the encouraging words of my mother, who would always saythe sky is the limit. Her life was certainly not an easy life, being a black woman coming from the south. She raised five children on her own because my father also passed away, when I was a little girl. So my mother raised five children on her own, cooking and cleaning houses for other people. She did not have a formal education but she was one of the smartest people I knew. She was very bright, very intelligent, and she always imparted optimism in us to do our very best.
Interviewer: Whats important to you, in becoming a therapistpsychologist?
Rosie: As a therapist, and as a clinical psychologist, we are the agents of change. I believe that we should never give up on life. We certainly are all interconnected in life, and we all need each other, regardless of our race, creed, color, regardless of our nationality. My lifeand how I interact with peopleis not a zerosum game, in the sense that my gains are not your losses, my losses are not your gains. I feel that my gains can help you win, and your gains can help me win. And so we all need help from one another."

Outdoorsman photography and console portraits line a wall. A photo of Steely and his dad holding a catch by the sea, another of him climbing a half dome. There's a jellyfish aquarium. The seating area is an ecosystem all its own with more plants and contained living micro systems. He eats pasta and watches television. Once he finishes eating he gets up, undresses, grabs his recall device and heads to the bathroom. Steely walks into a yellow shower. A D projection of a woman in blue washes his back.
Dunk. Break for the curb. Clark taps Steely on the ass, blows him a kiss. Clark shoves him. Steely stumbles and walks over to a vehicle parked on the side. Steely leans on the driver window and kisses the driver. Steely circles to the other side and sits in the passenger seat. Driver puts a dutch to Steely's mouth. Steely hits it. Steely and driver kiss blowing smoke out of their noses.

     Steely: Shakes head) 'Awe mandon't do thatI don't even know how it started.' leans in to kiss her again)
     Shoobie: 'Nope.'
     Steely: Kisses her face still) 'What you do all day anyway? When'd you even get here?'
Shoobie ignores him, and changes a song on the playlist she was his ride there in the first place). Steely crawls out of passenger window and talks over the car.
     Steely: 'So what's good for later? I need to shower.'
Matthew and Clark walk over to the carDanny goes inside to shower.
     Clark: W'sup Shoobie.' Kisses her on the cheek.)
     Clark: 'So you gon' draw my blood and I can't hit the blunt? You cold.'
Shoobie passes it to Clark.
     Steely: 'Imma be back later I left some shit in your house.'
     Matthew: 'What is it? I'll grab it for you now. You ain't comin' back. Y'all are about to get weird.'
     Steely: 'What an angelbut naw, imma come back though.'
     Matthew: 'Smiley faces...'
Wide road. Canopy of live oak trees and filtered sunlight. Low radio. Engine noise layered with shower scene. Engine noise. Love scene. Engine noise. Cut to black.
Steely is high off endorphins while his back is being rubbed by the lady in blue. He finishes his shower, heads to his bed and crash into sleep. Steely's blurry eyes open up to Shoobie lying next to him with the look of Christmas morning on her face. It's amish. The glass now gives the views pass up on the level. Shoobie has been dealing with Garten's vehicle for the last several hours.
     Shoobie: 'The majority of Garten's designs contain two access points. It's a motif of his.' 'This design in particular has nearly complete function solely from one key point. The second key point is hidden. I got its location off this thing's own thoughts. Whatever, take a seat.' Pointing to the car)
Steely takes a seat. Black cup of coffee in his hand. Shoobie has a rainbow coil of wires running from a handheld device into a port on the headlight of Garten's car.
     Shoobie: 'Wait for it.' As she works)
In a moment Steely's vision through the windshield glows and the city past the woods falls off into sky. His entire surroundings glow golden and white and the edges of his view fall off into endless sky. He seems to be on an island, floating high above any water. Steely jumps a bit, spills the coffee on his boxer shorts. It takes a moment for him to feel the sensation.
     Steely: 'Fuuuck....'
Steely jumps out of the car. Pulling off his burning shorts, eyes affixed to the fantastic view, which is fading back into reality all around him. His vision goes back to normal again. Shoobie smiles. Steely starts to wring out his shorts when he gets a new message notification.

Key Words,Frank Ocean,Boys Don’t Cry (Magazine),"{'year': 2016, 'month': 8, 'day': 20}","Christopher Chassol: laughs) So basically you're asking me..., what I think? I think everything is possible. I think it can be whatever you decide to be; whatever you choose.
FO: Chris, what the fuck are you talking about? you don't understand the question.
CC: The question is what do I think there was before the Big Bang. So  I think you can decide whatever you want because we have no clue. We are not astrophysicists; they get religious at the end.
Om'Mas Keith: And this is why there will always be a God principle/ When you get to the point where you can't explain everything, the human soul needs to find something because we can't accept not knowing. I'm a scientist. Everything I fuck with has been proven. That's like everything in my life.
CC: Really? Proven?
OK: Right, maths and science. It's like, this shit is real! Only in business and creating though. In love there's no rules. In love, you'll never know anything. Business can definitely know things. You can look at statistics in love and all that shit too,  but you'll always derive the fact that you'll never be able to predict anything. I think in business you can use models to predict outcomes. More so that in love.
FO: Wo have you guys gotten the best commentary on yourselves from? Has it been your enemies or your loved ones?
CC: Well it's my girl, of course. I do music to please girls, you know? At the beginning you do it for her to love me, because I want to shine in front of her.
OK: Like a diamond.
CC: I'm doing music for her to feel proud of me.
FO: You know that song, shine bright like a diamond?"" You don't know that song?
CC: No, it's from a movie? I don't know? Maybemaybe - it's a girl? Like Miley Cyrus? I don't know I'm not an entertainer.
OK: My mother used to always say weird shit to us, basically saying like we were a very select group of people in the hood who had some consciousness and were trying to get out. And she would always make those weird statements to reinforce that, I don't even want to repeat what she said because it doesn't sound good. Basically, telling me that I should rise above what was going on in the neighbourhood. To this day, just how ambiguous your parents or elders around you can be, my mother, my grandmother, they'd always say stuff like 'you're from here, but you're not of here.' Just a repeated mantra, always. 'Each one, teach one.' so when I talk to my mom it's all these paraphrases and lessons. When I talk to my grandmother , it's always this wisdom. Everybody older than me are the ones who really give me the commentary as I move forward.
CC: When we were talking, I was thinking of echoes in your life or phrases that people say when you are young... Phrases that stay. Short ones that constitute your vision. There was one guy, I was  and in a band. I was good, but I was not super good. The guy was and older guy in a bar. He said, 'Yeah, pretty good, your concert, but you don't have the sound.' I was really pissed off. I knew he was right and this phrase - I don't even know who this guy is, I met him ten seconds - but this phrase stayed to remind me that I'm not there.
OK: I had one guy do that. This is a pivotal moment in my beatmaking life. I was , I made these beasts and prepared them for this gentleman called Weldon Irvine who was a famous jazz musician. He came to my house, listened to my beats, and I knew they were great but he shot me down, like 'yeah they're a little busy bro.' It was my first shit of honesty that prepared me for what was going to come for the rest of my life. I always go back to that one scenario of people having that one opinion. You can let it destroy you, you have to add it to your repertoire and think about it. When he said that, I thought to myself, maybe there's a way to do things simple. I'm still on a quest for that to this day in my life, that level of simplicity, because of this interaction with Weldon.
FO: When I used to sing when I was younger, my mom would be like, 'stop hollering!' It used to make me all selfconscious about how I sounded, like my tone of voice or how loud I was, and I didn't want to sound like I was dying and shit. And then I discovered Prince at my mom's friend Jheri's house, I mean she used to have him on like everyday and I honestly didn't pay attention at first but I vividly remember the first time I heard 'Beautiful Ones' and this grown man singing for his life. Immediately I remember it clicking like , 'oh, it's okay to holler and scream and everything. Like, express yourself kid... Go off! So yeah, Prince basically made it all okay. Laughter) And I mean there was other stuff like my grandfather always correcting my speech, which was a regular thing. But for some reason I remember I was picking up a habit of saying, 'yes, indeed.' And like really stretching it out too which sounded country as hell. I think I was picking it up from my older twin cousins or whatever and he wasn't having it, at all. Lowkey I think he's the reason why I never picked up a strong New Orleans accent for real, which I kind if wish I did. I guess I could turn it on if I tried to but yea in general I probably just sound like I'm from anywhere in America.
OK: Talking like black people, what does it mean?
FO: Yeah, I heard that growing up sometimes. 'Oh, you talk white.' But you know what it means though.
OK: In the context that I grew up when I was told to talk white it was becuase I took the time to make sure everybody understood every word and used big words.
CC: It's about putting the white guy on the side of the intellect and putting the black guy on the side of the intuitive, primitive things. 'Oh, his language swings.' snaps fingers). 'It's close to dance. Close to the animals, to nature!' The white  guys speaks clearly like the brain. It's doing this when people say 'talking like white people' and 'talking like black people.' It's so stupid.
OK: That's at the core. So why are people still doing that right now? Still! In fifth grade saying to another kid, 'Why you talk black?' Why you talk white? Wigger!'
FO: True. But it's all changing all the time. There'll be new cultures that collide like this in the future and this will be old news.
OK: Do you like being alone?
CC: Yeah, I love it.
OK I hate being alone. I love to have so many people around me, much as I can. I like to have people sleeping in my house.
CC: I like my toilet. I need my space.
OK: No, everything's separate. You can't use my toilet. laughs) I like an environment where I'm in my world and there are people in the house, I don't know what it's about, but I like having people around me. I like entourage. I think I'm going to have a big entourage, really big.
FO: I'm not that way.
OK: You can be alone, huh?
FO: Yeah. I can be alone. But remember I used to have a bunch of people around my house all the time. All the time.
OK: Trusted crew, though?
FO: Eh, some randoms too.
CC: And people staying over and they wouldn't leave?
FO: Some people wouldn't leave, they'd just be there.
CC: So you're like 'so. so..' claps hands on knees)'  'what are we doing?'
OK: Do people do this at your flat?
CC: Yeah, they stay because the place is good. So I'm like 'So so so... I have to work... blah blah blah.' They won't leave! Being alone is good. With this, the invention of the iPod, it changed everything. You have all things, all of this music everywhere. The Proustrian feeling, the feeling of nostalgia, you can bring nostalgia in a place where you have never experienced it before. You had Walkmans but the iPod changed everything.
OK: Data revival. That's what brings those feelings. Seeing it, it gives you unlimited... It's like fucking drugs, man.
CC: I love good nostalgia. Nostalgia that goes for a while. It's crazy when music is so powerful. It can still be technical and poetic, like 'I know which chord makes me feel about Wednesday afternoon in .' Think like that. You could almost make an Excel document about it.
OK: Take for instance, every time I hear 'Don't Forget About Me' from the Breakfast Club. Whenever I immediately hear that song, I get this immediate image of being; because the only time I saw this movie was on WPIX  in syndication and it would come on Saturdays once every three months or something like that... But I always remember catching it at home on a Saturday,  years old. It takes me right back to that time, every time.
Zing Tsejeng: Do you think people are mostalgic these days?
OK: I don't know.
CC: No, I don't think so."

See on both sides like Chanel
Swimmin' laps through pool water
Heated like I'm underworld
Hide my tattoos in Shibuya
Police think I'm of the underworld
My guy pretty like a girl
And he got fight stories to tell
I see both sides like Chanel
See on both sides like Chanel
Swimmin' laps through pool water
Heated like I'm underworld
Hide my tattoos in Shibuya
Police think I'm of the underworld"
Solo (JD. Reid Remix) [Mixed],Frank Ocean,KITTYSAYWORD at 214 Mulberry (DJ Mix),"{'year': 2023, 'month': 9, 'day': 21}","Hand me a towel, I'm dirty dancing
By myself, gone off tabs of that acid
Form me a circle, watch my Jagger
Might lose my jacket and hit a solo, one time
We too loud in public, them police turned down the function
Now we outside and the timing's perfect
Forgot to tell you
Gotta tell you how much I vibe with you
And we don't gotta be solo
Now stay away from highways
My eyes like them red lights
Right now, I prefer yellow
Redbone, so mellow
Fuck 'round, be cutting you
Think we were better off solo
I got that act right in the Windy City that night
No trees to blow through, but blow me and I owe you
Two grams when the sun rise
Smoking good, rolling solo
Solo Solo), solo Solo)
Ssolo Solo), ssolo Solo)

It's hell on Earth and the city's on fire
Inhale, in hell, there's heaven
There's a bull and a matador dueling in the sky
Inhale, in hell, there's heaven
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Solo
Solo

Solo

I'm skipping showers and switching socks, sleeping good and long
Bones feeling dense as fuck, wish a nigga would cross
And catch a solo, on time
White leaf on my boxers, green leaf turn to vapors for the low
And that mean cheap, 'cause ain't shit free and I know it
Even love ain't, 'cause this nut cost, that clinic killed my soul
But you gotta hit the pussy raw, though
Now your baby mama ain't so vicious
All she want is her picket fence
And you protest and you picket sign
But them courts won't side with you
Won't let you fly solo, yeah
I wanted that act right in Colorado that night
I brought trees to blow through, but it's just me and no you
Stayed up 'til my phone died
Smoking big, rolling solo

It's hell on Earth and the city's on fire
Inhale, in hell, there's heaven
There's a bull and a matador dueling in the sky
Inhale, in hell, there's heaven
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh"
Ivy (Mixed),Frank Ocean,"Fitness: Run, April 2024 (DJ Mix)","{'year': 2024, 'month': 4, 'day': 12}","I thought that I was dreamin' when you said you love me
The start of nothin'
I had no chance to prepare, I couldn't see you comin'
The start of nothin'
Ooh, I could hate you now
It's quite alright to hate me now
When we both know that deep down
The feeling still deep down is good

If I could see through walls, I could see you're faking
If you could see my thoughts, you would see our faces
Safe in my rental like an armored truck back then
We didn't give a fuck back then
I ain't a kid no more
We'll never be those kids again
We'd drive to Syd's
Had the X back then, back then
No matter what I did, my waves wouldn't dip back then
Everything sucked back then, we were friends

I thought that I was dreamin' when you said you love me
The start of nothin'
I had no chance to prepare, I couldn't see you comin'
The start of nothin'
Ooh, I could hate you now
It's quite alright to hate me now
But we both know that deep down
The feeling still deep down is good

In the halls of your hotel
Arm around my shoulder so I could tell
How much I meant to you, meant it sincere back then
We had time to kill back then
You ain't a kid no more, we'll never be those kids again
It's not the same, ivory's illegal, don't you remember?

I broke your heart last week
You'll probably feel better by the weekend
Still remember, had you going crazy
Screamin' my name, the feeling deep down is good"
