Range Life,Pavement,"Crooked Rain, Crooked Rain","{'year': 1994, 'month': 2, 'day': 14}","After the glow, the scene, the stage, the set
A talk becomes slow, but there's one thing I'll never forget
Hey, you gotta pay your dues
Before you pay the rent
Over the turnstiles and out in the traffic
There's ways of living, it's the way I'm living
Right or wrong, it's all that I can do
And I wouldn't wanna let you be

I want a range life
If I could settle down
If I could settle down
Then I would settle down
I want a range life
If I could settle down
If I could settle down
Then I would settle down


Run from the pigs, the fuzz, the cops, the heat
Pass me your gloves, this crime, it is never complete
Until you snort it up and shoot it down
You're never gonna feel free
Out on my skateboard, the night is just humming
And the gums smacks are the pulse I'll follow if my Walkman fades
But I've got absolutely no one
No one but myself to blame

But don't worry, we're in no hurry
School's out, what did you expect?

I want a range life
If I could settle down
If I could settle down
Then I would settle down
I want a range life
If I could settle down
If I could settle down
Then I would settle down
Yeah


Out on tour with The Smashing Pumpkins
Nature kids, I, they don't have no function
I don't understand what they mean
And I could really give a fuck
The Stone Temple Pilots, they're elegant bachelors
They're foxy to me, are they foxy to you?
I will agree they deserve absolutely nothing
Nothing more than me
Dreamin', dream, dream, dream, dream, dream"
Gold Soundz,Pavement,"Crooked Rain, Crooked Rain","{'year': 1994, 'month': 6, 'day': 19}","Go back to those gold sounds
And keep my advent to your self
Because it's nothing I don't like
Is it a crisis or a boring change?
When it's central, so essential
It has a nice ring when you laugh
At the lowlife opinions
And they're coming to the chorus now

I keep my address to yourself 'cause we need secrets
We need secretcretcretcretcrets back right now

Because I never wanna make you feel
That you're social, never ignorant soul
Believe in what you wanna do
And do you think that is a major flaw
When they rise up in the falling rain?
And if you stay around with your knuckles ground down
The trial's over, the weapon's found

Keep my address to myself because it's secret
'Cause it's secretcretcretcretcretcretcret
'Cretcretcretcretcretcret back right now

So drunk in the August sun
And you're the kind of girl I like
Because you're empty and I'm empty
And you can never quarantine the past
Did you remember in December
That I won't need you when I'm gone?
And if I go there, I won't stay there
Because I'm sitting here too long

I've been sitting here too long
And I've been wasted, advocating that word for the last word
Last words come up, all you've got to waste"

Do you think it's gonna make him change?
I'm just a boy with a new haircut
And that's a pretty nice haircut

I saw your girlfriend, and she was
Eating her fingers like they're just another meal
But she waits there
In the levee washes
Mixin' cocktails with a plastictipped cigar

My eyes stick to all the shiny robes
You wear on the protein delta strip
In an abandoned houseboat
I will wait there
I'll be waiting forever
I'm waitin', waitin', waitin', waitin', waitin', waitin', waitin', waiting
Go


Minerals, ice deposit daily
Drop off the first shiny robe
I've got a lot of things I want to sell, but
Not here, babe
You took 'em all

Every time I sit around, I find I'm shot
Every time I sit around, I find I'm shot
Every time I turn around, my friend
Every time I sit around, my friend
Every time, every time, every time, every time, every time
Every time, you're my

And now I see the long and short
The middle and what's in between

Here,Pavement,Slanted and Enchanted ,"{'year': 1992, 'month': 4, 'day': 20}","I was dressed for success
But success it never comes
And I'm the only one who laughs
At your jokes when they are so bad
And your jokes are always bad
But they're not as bad as this

Come join us in a prayer
We'll be waiting, waiting where
Everything's ending here

And all the sterile striking it defends an empty dock you cast away
And rain upon your forehead where the mist's for hire if it's
Just too clear
Let's spend our last quarter stamps randomly
Go down to the outlet once again

Painted portraits of minions and slaves
Crotchmavens and onenight plays
Are they the only ones who laugh
At the jokes when they are so bad?
And the jokes they're always bad
But they're not as bad as this

Come join us in a prayer
We'll be waiting, waiting where
Everything's ending here

And all the Spanish candles they sold away have gone to this
And a runon piece of mountain travels, shivers, runs, down the freeway
I guess she spent her last quarter randomly
We guess a guess is the best I'll do, I'll do

Last time, last time is the best time I spent"

Freeze, don't move

Glance, don't stare
Soon you're being told to recognize your heirs
No, not me
I'm an island of such great complexity
Stress surrounds
In the muddy peaceful center of this town
Tell me off
In the hotel lobby right in front of all the bellboys and the overfriendly concierge

To raze the demon settlement

And you're my factcheckin' cuz Aww)

Well, focus on the quasar in the mist
The Kaiser has a cyst
And I'm a blank want list
The qualms you have and if they stick
They will drown you in a crick
In the neck of a woods

Tired nation on the fly
Everybody knows advice
That was given out for free
Lots of details to discern

Got crystal ice picks, no gift for the gab

He never, he never complains when it's hot

He foaled a swollen daughter in the sauna playing contract bridge
They're soaking up the fauna, doing blotters, I don't know which..which..which
Boys are dying on these streets

I know the medical world could knock you out
To sell the coins that you jayed last Thursdayhey
Dine by candlelight, and hold your savings tight
You never, you never know when the bridge falls apart

He spoke of latent causes, sterile gauzes, and the bedside morale
He traipse around the table talking sentences so incomplete..plete...plete

I don't want to split up fiftyfifty
That's the way we do it in this rose town
I've got all the glory in the world
I hope it doesn't floor you before you go
Room service calls in the random falls
Go!

Whenever, whenever, whenever, whenever, whenever
Whenever I feel fine
I'm going to walk away from all this, all that
Groovy groovy kitty, you little little pity
With your slip shag watching back
You skinny skinny people don't like that when you con them
Spell me

Spritzer on ice in New York City
Isn't it a pity
You never had anything to mix with that?
Listen to the tender
Behind the open chest in the hall
Room service calls
I'm blue green and cream and blue

Whenever, whenever, whenever
Whenever I feel fine

Swingin' nunchakus like you just don't care

Kiss the wine
Magic Christians chew the rind
'Cause bad girls are always bad girls
Let 'em in"
