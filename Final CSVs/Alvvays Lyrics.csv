Dreams Tonite,Alvvays,Antisocialites,"{'year': 2017, 'month': 7, 'day': 25}","Rode here on the bus
Now you're one of us
It was magic hour
Counting motorbikes
On the turnpike
One of Eisenhower's

Live your life on a merrygoround
Who starts a fire just to let it go out?

If I saw you on the street
Would I have you in my dreams tonight?
If I saw you on the street
Would I have you in my dreams tonight, tonight?

On a weird guitar
Said you wrote a while
In the waking hour
In fluorescent light
Antisocialites
Watch a wilting flower

If I saw you on the street
Would I have you in my dreams tonight?
If I saw you on the street
Would I have you in my dreams tonight, tonight?
If I saw you on the street
Would I have you in my dreams tonight, tonight?
Don't let motion distort everything
If I saw you on the street
Would I have you in my dreams tonight, tonight?
Don't let motion distort everything

Don't sit by the phone for me
Wait at home for me, all alone for me
Your face was supposed to be hanging over me like a rosary
So morose for me, seeing ghosts of me
Writing oaths to me, is it so naïve to wonder?

If I saw you on the street
Would I have you in my dreams tonight, tonight?
Don't let motion distort everything
If I saw you on the street
Would I have you in my dreams tonight, tonight?
Don't let motion distort everything
If I saw you on the street
Would I have you in my dreams tonight, tonight?
Don't let motion distort everything
If I saw you on the street
Would I have you in my dreams tonight, tonight?
Don't let motion distort everything"
"Archie, Marry Me",Alvvays,Alvvays,"{'year': 2014, 'month': 7, 'day': 22}","You've expressed explicitly your contempt for matrimony
You've student loans to pay and will not risk the alimony
We spend our days locked in a room, content inside a bubble
And in the nighttime we go out and scour the streets for trouble
Hey, hey
Marry me, Archie
Hey, hey
Marry me, Archie

During the summer, take me sailing out on the Atlantic
I won't set my sights on other seas, there is no need to panic
So, honey, take me by the hand and we can sign some papers
Forget the invitations, floral arrangements and bread makers
Hey, hey
Marry me, Archie
Hey, hey
Marry me, Archie

Too late to go out
Too young to stay in
They're talking about
Us living in sin
Hey, hey
Marry me, Archie
Hey, hey
Marry me, Archie
Hey, hey
Marry me Archie
Hey, hey
ARCHIE, oh, yeah"
Adult Diversion,Alvvays,Alvvays,"{'year': 2013, 'month': 10, 'day': 28}","How do I get close to you?
Even if you don't notice
As I admire you on the subway
When it's dark outside your house
You won't let anybody out
And keep a padlock on the door, well

One more cocktail
And I'm on your trail

If I should fall
Act as though it never happened
I will retreat
And sit inside so very quietly

How do I grow old with you?
Even if you don't notice
As I pass by you on the sidewalk
When it's dark outside your house
You won't let anybody out
You're keeping a dead girl in the closet
One more cocktail
Is it a good time?
Or is it highly inappropriate?

If I should fall
Act as though it never happened
I will retreat
And then go back to university
If I should fall
Act as though it never happened
I will retreat
And sit inside so very quietly

I won't waste a Moment)
I won't waste a—
I won't waste a—

If I should fall
Act as though it never happened
I will retreat
And sit inside so very quietly
If I should fall
Act as though it never happened
I will retreat
And then go back to university"
In Undertow,Alvvays,Antisocialites,"{'year': 2017, 'month': 6, 'day': 6}","You find a wave and try to hold on for as long as you can
You made a mistake you'd like to erase and I understand
What's left for you and me?"" I ask that question rhetorically
Can't buy into astrology, and won't rely on the moon for anything

No turning, there's no turning
There's no turning back after what's been said
No turning, there's no turning
There's no turning back

Meditate, play solitaire, take up self defense
When you get old and faded out, will you want your friends?
What's left for you and me? You respond to my question metaphorically
Don't read into psychology and won't rely on your mood for anything

No turning, there's no turning
There's no turning back after what was said
No turning, there's no turning
There's no turning back after what's been said

You find a wave and try to hold on for as long as you can
You made a mistake you'd like to erase and I understand
What's next for you and me? I'll take suggestions
We toss and turn in undertow, time to let go
There's no turning, there's no turning
There's no turning back after what's transpired
No turning, there's no turning
There's no turning back, it's so uninspired
No turning, there's no turning
There's no turning back, no turning back"
Not My Baby,Alvvays,Antisocialites,"{'year': 2017, 'month': 9, 'day': 8}","Now that youre not my baby, I'll go do whatever I want

Because Im really not there

And now that youre not my baby
Ill go do whatever I want
No need to sit at home with the dial tone
'Cause I dont care

Close your eyes and then count to ten
You can tell your friends that I dont make sense
And I dont care

Because Im really not there
I'm really not there

The lake was frozen over long ago

Now that youre not my baby
Now youre not)
Now that youre not my baby

You sought an eye
So did I for an island
You sought an eye

Traded my rosecoloured shades for a wide lens
Used to make noise, now, I much prefer silence

Party Police,Alvvays,Alvvays,"{'year': 2014, 'month': 7, 'day': 22}","Walking through the trees, I never really know what's on your mind
Is it ever me, or just someone you've left behind?
Floating through a dream, I never could make out the words you said
Sentences are bouncing back and forth inside my head

You don't have to leave, you could just stay here with me
Forget all the party police, we can find comfort in debauchery

Fighting through the fog, I can't believe it rained all summer long
When every day's a hurricane, you know there's something wrong
I see you every day, it's hard to figure out what happens next
I cannot decipher conversation in your head

You don't have to leave, you could just stay here with me
Forget all the party police, we can find comfort in debauchery
You don't have to leave, you could just stay here with me
Forget all the local police, we can find comfort in biology

We wrote our names on the overpass and I hope it lasts forever
Don't have to
You don't have to
You don't have to leave, you could just stay here with me
Forget all the party police, we could find comfort in debauchery
You don't have to leave, you could just stay here with me

Ones Who Love You,Alvvays,Alvvays,"{'year': 2014, 'month': 7, 'day': 22}","Take, take from the ones who love you, ooh
Leave, leave with the ones who don't, ooh

I will be on my bike
I won't be stuck inside
I will be taking flight

They, they are the ones who love you, ooh
We, we are the ones who don't, ooh
Hang up on the ones who need you, ooh
Watch out for the ones who won't

When lightning strikes
I will be on my bike
I won't be stuck inside
I will be taking flight
And when the wheels come off
I'll be an astronaut
But I won't be lost in space
I will be skipping rocks
When you live on an island
Nothing ever falls in place
The winters are violent
And you can't ever feel your face
You can't fucking feel your face

And when lightning strikes
I willl be on my bike
I won't be stuck inside

I'll be on Lippincott

Next of Kin,Alvvays,Alvvays,"{'year': 2014, 'month': 7, 'day': 22}","We walked along the rocks for nearly an hour
I caught the way you looked at me in the sunlight
You took something before you went in the shower
To help suppress the things that make you feel uptight

If I'd known you couldn't swim
We would never have gone in

I left my love in the river
The only one who sees
I lost his hand in the current
It was the life I wanted and I'd hoped for
And now I am left sifting through the leaves

The sun so hot, I saw his skin through his tshirt
The grass so tall, we knew we wouldn't be found
We climbed into the stream sure no one would be heard
And in no time at all, there wasn't a sound

If I'd known you couldn't swim
We would never have gone in
I left my love in the river
The only one who sees
I lost his hand in the current
It was the life I wanted and I'd hoped for
And now I am left sifting through the leaves

No color to his skin
Inform the next of kin
No color to his skin

I left my love in the river
The only one I see
I lost his hand in the current
And now I am left looking through the trees

Ooh
Ooh"
Atop a Cake,Alvvays,Alvvays,"{'year': 2014, 'month': 7, 'day': 22}","I lie on a sofa awake
It's what you said last night
You'd like us on top of a cake
But you won't let me take a bite

Flowers arriving in fleets
Can't we talk about this?
Why let the state in our sheets?
Can't we do without it?

Well, I don't mean to wind you up
But I'd like to slow it down
How do I remain a pup
If you put me in a gown?

What's it got to do with you?
What's it got to do with me?
How could I lose control
When you're driving from the backseat?
What's it got to do with you?
What's it got to do with me?
How could I lose control
When you're driving from the backseat?
Corners begin to repeat
I think we're getting lost
We walked to the end of the street
But we were bitten by the frost

So if you have to thaw me out
You can put me in a pail
Can we take another route?
I don't want to wear a vail

What's it got to do with you?
What's it got to do with me?
How could I lose control
When you're driving from the backseat?
What's it got to do with you?
What's it got to do with me?
How could I lose control
When you're driving from the backseat?

I'll wait in the lobby for someone to show
And if they don't come, I will know where to go
The bodies are lined up outside in the hall
I don't want to decay in a mall
If everything you say is true
Then why would I disagree?
How could I lose control?

What's it gotta do with you?
What's it gotta do with me?
How could I lose control
When you're driving from the backseat?
When you're driving from the backseat"
Plimsoll Punks,Alvvays,Antisocialites,"{'year': 2017, 'month': 8, 'day': 17}","When I chip through your candy coating
You're stuffed with insulation
Just strawberry ice cream floating
With a sprinkle of indignation
Cherry under knot of shoestring
Conflate and agitate

You're a plimsoll punk
You're a plimsoll punk

And you're gettin' me down, gettin' me down, gettin' me down
Gettin' me down down down, you're gettin' me down
Gettin' me down, gettin' me down, gettin' me down
Plimsoll punk

Your posture's blocking out any possible light
I can hardly see
This conversation spirals into a fight
I can barely breathe

Who ran from Roman candles
Underneath a willow weeping?
Do the tealights on your mantel
Illuminate that summer feeling?
You're the seashell in my sandal
That's slicing up my heel
You're a plimsoll punk
You're a plimsoll punk

And you're getting me down, gettin' me down, gettin' me down
Gettin' me down down, down you're gettin' me down
Rrrracking my brain, trying to escape, getting me down
Plimsoll punk
Plimsoll punk

Your posture's blocking out any possible light
I can no longer see
This conversation spirals into a fight
I can barely breathe

Gettin' me down, gettin' me down, you're gettin' me down

Gettin' me down, gettin' me down, you're gettin' me down

Lollipop (Ode to Jim),Alvvays,Antisocialites,"{'year': 2017, 'month': 9, 'day': 8}","Saw Jim Reid in the corridor
And I wondered if he could ever see me that way
He was on my list at the grocery store
When you grabbed my wrist and said you liked my keychain
Read your feature in the weekly paper
And honestly, I found it a little bit bloated
Friday, we fell through the coffee table
And thats when I discovered that my heart exploded

How?
How?

You're a lollipop
In the form of a lightning bolt
You're a lollipop in my hair
But I'm a gumdrop
Am I ever gonna fit that mould?
'Cause I don't have the patience to wait in line for you

When I came back to apologize
You asked me if I was intrigued by LSD
I sat next to you on the picnic bench
And before I knew it, you were flying next to me
I met your baby at the exposition
And frankly, I found it a little unnerving
I let you know when we were driving home
And all I can remember is the fact that we're swerving
You're a lollipop
In the form of a lightning bolt
You're a lollipop in my hair
How could I ever obtain you?)
But you're a doorstop
When you're lying on the bathroom floor
And I don't have the time to wait in line for you
How could I ever betray you?)

Alter my state to get through this date
You're alone in this picture
And it swallows me whole)
Alter my state to get through this date
You're alone in this picture
And it swallows me whole)
Alter my state to get through this date
You're alone in this picture)
Alter my state to get through this date
And it swallows me whole
You're alone in this picture)
Alter my state to get through this date

You're a lollipop
How could I ever obtain you?)
In the form of a lightning bolt
You're a lollipop in my hair
How could I ever betray you?)
You look like Iggy Pop
Circa ' or '
How could I ever obtain you?)
Because I don't have the time wait in line for you
How could I ever betray you?)
Wait for you"
Saved by a Waif,Alvvays,Antisocialites,"{'year': 2017, 'month': 9, 'day': 8}","New Saturday
In the park, didnt think you fell that hard
Woke up again
Woke up and you wanted a new start
New Saturday
In the park, didnt think you fell that hard
Oh, Adrian
The silver maple never saw you coming

Stay where you are
State what you are
Stay where you are
And no one gets hurt

You cut your hair
Now you look like a little boy
You climbed the stairs
So high, you cant come down from there
Said you wanted to get it together but you dont
Said you wanted to get it together but you wont

Say something, waste something
Change your life
Take something, break something
Make your flight
Say something, anything
Mommy wants you to be a doctor
So she can tell her friends youre like your father
And if its all for the sake of conversation
Then maybe you should try a new vocation
Oh, saved by a waif and the weight of your wayfarers
Not to be confused with hippies in Toronto

You cut your hair
Now you look like a little boy
You climbed the stairs
So high, you cant come down from there
Said you wanted to get it together but you dont
Said you wanted to get it together but you wont
Oh, saved by a waif and the weight of your wayfarers"

Blue Rev behind the rink

Circumspect when you call collect
To see if I would keep it

Paradise and I find myself paralyzed
Knowing all too well terrified
But I'll find my way

Moving to the country
Gonna have that baby
Wait tables in town
I know word gets around
Moving to the country
Gonna have this baby
See how it goes
See how it grows

Knowing all too well terrified

Forget About Life,Alvvays,Antisocialites,"{'year': 2017, 'month': 9, 'day': 8}","I thought of going in the lake and swallowing
Thought that I had unplugged the phone until it rang
When the phases of the moon, they dont apply
When accomplishing a simple task takes several tries

Did you want to forget about life?
Did you want to forget about life with me tonight?
Underneath this flickering light
Did you want to forget about life with me tonight?

Left the apartment in a state of disarray
Tried out the synthesizer you bought yesterday
When the failures of the past, they multiply
And you trivialize the things that keep your hand from mine

Did you want to forget about life?
Did you want to forget about life with me tonight?
Under condominium signs
Did you want to forget about life with me tonight? Woo!

Do you want to forget about life?
Do you want to forget about life with me tonight?
Underneath this flickering light
Do you want to forget about life with me tonight?

Inhaling this undrinkable wine
Forget everything tonight)
Forget about life with me tonight?
Forget everything tonight)

Did you want towhoaohoh
Forget everything tonight)"

Kill the buzz with your decrees and conspiracy theories

I die on the inside every time
You will never be alright
I will never be your type

Gambling with your working visa, youve got something to prove
Take a photo of the Mona Lisa, get thrown out of the Louvre
And with vomit on your feet, clamoring bon appétit

I die on the inside every time
You will never be alright
I will never be your type
I will never be your type

Knew that I would never be your type
Knew that I would never be your type

Hop that fence if you'd like to, then dissolve into the night
All depends how it strikes you, without reason, without rhyme

Rifling through your toxicology

When you whisper you don't think of me that way
When I mention you don't mean that much to me
To me

An outcast of modern society
Suffering from a case of sobriety
Shortcomings, well, you can take your pick
When you are catering to one of your nervous tics

When you whisper you don't think of me that way
When I mention you don't mean that much to me
To me, to me

You know that it won't take much longer before it's wrong
You know that it won't take much longer now that I'll be gone
It's gone, the sun is gone

Local centre off the highway

Just collecting the rubble

Well I waited for you out here, but that was just delusional
And I've painted all these pictures of Earth, but that's unusual
Unusual to you

Met at a seminar, shared the same table
Brushed by you at the bar, didn't match your description
It soon became my prescription
I think of the junipers in the spring growing
Fall up on Jupiter, it doesn't draw a reaction
Temporary distraction

Surface

Instead of an eruption
We bubble, only briefly
When there is erosion
We both regret it, deeply

When the crowd separated, the officer said you were already gone
Appetite minuscule
Middle of the night

Racket in the hall, caution to the breeze
Say you'll climb your way out of your wake now
Velvet curtain drawn, flowers at your feet
Say you'll contemplate how you're weighed down

Is the colour of burning embers
If you wake up, will you remember
The awful things I said at the еdge of the bed?
Thrashing likе a great white I feel the northern tide)
As they rolled you up on a stretcher Crashing on the pines)
And the faint words of Jessica Fletcher I feel the northern tide)
Were drowned out by the sound of Crashing on the pines)

Why would I ever fall in love again
When every detail is over the guardrail?

What becomes of this? It's hard to say

And I'll sleep better knowing it's in the past

Looking back, I should have known
All the nights that I spent in outer space
Cigarettes and old regrets piled in a stack
Out in the back of my brain

When you walk away
Better be for good

I put my money on a horse
Who won't be steered on any course or lane
And if I ever see a dime
You'd take that money to divide and separate
When you walk away
It better be for good

I know you'll be there in the rain
Glowing like the first night, telling me you've changed
I know you'll be there in the rain
Glowing like the first night, trying to explain

That when you walk away
It's gonna be for good
You were my Tom Verlaine
Just sitting on the hood"

Tile by tile, step by step, 'til I reach a wall
No use in forging on, I try wholeheartedly
But still end up on your lawn

'Cause I'm still waiting on my invitation
I shouldn't have ever gone in the truck
The whole ride writing in your condensation
I shouldn't have ever been calling it love

At night I take the calls from telemarketers
In hopes of hearing your drawl
I let them blather on without a thought
I surrender my credit card

'Cause I'm still combing through missed connеctions
I shouldn't have ever followеd you up
I'm out here swimming in the wrong direction
I shouldn't have ever been calling it love
I'm still waiting)

Am I still giving off the wrong impression?
I shouldn't have ever dialled you up
And I'm still lifting all your old expressions
I shouldn't have ever been calling it love
I'm still waiting
I'm still waiting"
Very Online Guy,Alvvays,Blue Rev,"{'year': 2022, 'month': 9, 'day': 22}","He's a very online guy
He likes to hit reply
He's incredibly vigilant
Hair with the feathered wings
He likes to pull the strings
It's incredibly visible

We all know everything that he says and does
Leave your location on and just follow the buzz

He's only one filter away
He's only one follow, one filter away

He's a very online guy
He types his cool replies
He's incredibly animal
Front of the wеdding trains
He laps up all domains
And he loves a patio

Hе's only one flicker away
He's only one photo, one filter away
Like a thinning wave, what was it supposed to be?
The truth is I'm afraid of sudden change
But when you're close to me, does anyone notice?
Life disintegrates, what was it supposed to be?
The truth is I'm afraid to turn away
But when you're ghosting me, does anyone notice?

He's only one filter away
He's only one photo, one flicker away
He's only one photo, one follow, one filter away

I see you getting fit
I can't make sense of it
At night, you roll up your jeans
And pull on your velveteen
Tonight you're on the stairs
What are you doing there?
Take off your lethargy
And down the bannister, you slide

Who is she?
Because I know that it can't be me
Who is she?
Because I know that it can't be

A closetful of lace
Acquired recently
Who am I to debase
In this economy?
Is she a perfect ten?
Have you found Christ again?
You tell me you don't have the time
To cop to it and vanish in the night
Who is she?
Because I know that it can't be me
Who is she?
Because I know that it can't be me

You fell away and I know how it all boils down
You hesitate, maintain charade
And I fall to the bottle, the bottom again

We used to tell each other everything
And now we're passing ships in night
We used to tell each other all the lies
And in a fairly civil way
Whatever gets you through the night

Who is she?
Because I know that it can't be me
Who is she?
Because I know that it can't be me

Stuck out my hand, grabbed it and ran

You can't recreate all the things that are read

It took a while but I'm trying to get over it
Presbyterian ministers
Travel in packs and never split
They deviate in the tiniest concepts
I heard you ask me to smile
Detour right off of the road
Don't ever ask me to smile
Which dress is she going to wear?
What's to be done with her hair?
Don't ever ask me to smile
You'll spend the rest of your days
Taking your foot off the brake
Foot on the brake, foot on the-

On the banks of rolling isles

Pedantic poetry and I would smile

And if I could retrace it
I'd match the steps we took
To merely recreate it, lie to myself
