The Wire,Haim,Days Are Gone (Deluxe Edition),"{'year': 2012, 'month': 8, 'day': 9}","You know I'm bad at communication
It's the hardest thing for me to do
And it's said it's the most important part
That relationships go through
And I gave it all away, just so I could say that
Well, I know, I know, I know, I know
That you're gonna be okay anyway

You know there's no rhyme or reason
For the way you turned out to be
I didn't go and try to change my mind
Not intentionally
I know it's hard to hear me say it
But I can't bear to stay in
I just know, I know, I know, I know
That you're gonna be okay anyway

Always keep your heart locked tight
Don't let your mind retire
Oh, but I just couldn't take it
I tried hard not to fake it
But I fumbled it when it came down to the wire

It felt right Hey!)
It felt right, oh
But I fumbled it when it came down to the wire
It felt right Hey!)
It felt right, oh
But I fumbled it when it came down to the wire

No need to use your imagination
Try and make it what you want it to be
Because I'm sorry I did what I did, but
It came naturally
And I gave it all away just so I could say that
Well, I know, I know, I know, I know
That you're gonna be okay anyway

When I tried to keep myself together
After all the opportunities
I tried to stay true to you
And I tried to do what you wanted from me
And I gave it all away just to hear you say that
Well, I know, I know, I know, I know
That you're gonna be okay anyway Hey!)
Always keep your heart locked tight

Always keep your heart locked tight
Don't let your mind retire, oh

I tried hard not to fake it
But I fumbled it when it came down to the wire

Gasoline,Haim,Women in Music Pt. III,"{'year': 2020, 'month': 6, 'day': 26}","You took me back
But you shouldn't have
Now it's your fault if I mess around
I took a drag
But I shouldn't have
Now I'm coughing up like I
Never smoked a pack

Gasoline, pretty please
I want to get off
But you're such a tease
Throw the keys back to me
Go on and kick off your boots
In the passenger seat

I get sad, you know I get sad
And I can't look past what I'm sad about
You did me bad
And I did it back
You needed ass, well, what's
Wrong with that?

Gasoline, pretty please
I want to get off
But you're such a tease
Throw the keys back to me
Go on and kick off your boots
In the passenger seat

We're watching the sunrise from the kitchen counter
When you lie in between my legs, it doesn't matter
You say you wanna go slower but I wanna go faster
Faster and faster

Gasoline, pretty please
I want to get off
But you're such a tease"
Now I’m In It,Haim,Women in Music Pt. III,"{'year': 2019, 'month': 10, 'day': 30}","Looking in the mirror again and again
Wishing the reflection would tell me something
I, I can't get a hold of myself
I can't get outta this situation
Walking in a straight line, thinking about last time
This time, I said I would do this right
Said I would never break this promise
But now I'm back to counting on us

We cannot be friends
Cannot pretend
That it makes sense
We cannot be friends
Cannot pretend
That it makes sense

'Cause now I'm in it
But I've been trying to find my way back for a minute
Damn, I'm in it
And I've been trying to find my way back for a minute

Locking all the doors to my house, I'm alone in my head
But I wish you were in my bed
Can't get a read on myself
Gotta change this situation
Something in the way that I felt when I woke up
Told me that I shouldn't give in, give up hope
Told me that I shouldn't fight what I felt
Told me that I should not let go 'cause

We cannot be friends
Cannot pretend
That it makes sense

'Cause now I'm in it
But I've been trying to find my way back for a minute
Damn, I'm in it
And I've been trying to find my way back for a minute
'Cause now I'm in it
And I've been trying to find my way back for a minute
And the rain keeps coming down along the ceiling
And I can hear it
But I can't feel it, oh

Took me so long
To fall
Now I'm in it, now I'm in it

'Cause now I'm in it
And I've been trying to find my way back for a minute
And the rain keeps coming down along the ceiling
And I can hear it
But I can't feel it, oh"
Want You Back,Haim,Something to Tell You,"{'year': 2017, 'month': 5, 'day': 3}","Some things are long forgotten
Some things were never said
We were on one endless road
But I had a wandering heart
I said we were opposite lovers
Said it from the beginning
You kept tryin' to prove me wrong
Said you'd always see it through
And I know that I ran you down
So you ran away with your heart

But just know that I want you back
Just know that I want you back
Just know that I want you
I'll take the fall and the fault in us
I'll give you all the love I never gave before I left you
Just know that I want you back
Just know that I want you back
Just know that I want you
I'll take the fall and the fault in us
I'll give you all the love I never gave before I left you

I know it's hard to hear it
And it may never be enough
But don't take it out on me now
'Cause I blame it all on myself
And I had a fear of forgiveness
Said it from the beginning
I was too proud to say I was wrong
Said you'd always see it through
But all that time is gone, no more fearing control
I'm ready for the both of us now

So just know that I want you back
Just know that I want you back
Just know that I want you
I'll take the fall and the fault in us
I'll give you all the love I never gave before I left you
Just know that I want you back

When I'm near you
You can't feel me

You end up mad at me for makin' a mess
I can't understand
Why you don't understand me, baby
And every day I wake up and I make money for myself

Laughing together like our thoughts are harmonized
Been that way since '
Give me direction when it is hard to fight
Three roads, one light
Now and then I can lean my back to yours
Travelin' like our feet don't touch the floor

One I wish I could see now
You always remind me that memories will last
These arms reach out
You were there to protect me like a shield
Long hair, running with me through the field
Everywhere, you've been with me all along

Up from a Dream,Haim,Women in Music Pt. III,"{'year': 2020, 'month': 6, 'day': 26}","I was dreaming again, you were there with me
We were on the beach, running in the sea
You pointed to a sign, but in dreams, you can't read
And in that moment, I snapped again

Something you see wakes you up from the dream
Wanna go back to sleep but now you're up from the dream
Walk into the kitchen, pull the dishes from the sink
And you have changed in the blink of an eye

Pretty baby
Innocently
Change the channel
On the TV

Something you see wakes you up from the dream
Wanna go back to sleep but now you're up from the dream
Walk into the kitchen, pull the dishes from the sink
And you have changed in the blink of an eye
Something you see wakes you up from the dream
Wanna go back to sleep but now you're up from the dream
Walk into the kitchen, pull the dishes from the sink
And you have changed in the blink of an eye

I could always dream
Could always leave
Could always breathe
And still picture you there by my side
I could always slip out the front door
Find my way home
Only to crawl into bed next to you
At the end of the night

We were lying awake or so it seemed
Trying to figure out what was happening
Are we already up from the dream?
Or do we need to wake up again?

Something you see wakes you up from the dream
Wanna go back to sleep but now you're up from the dream
Walk into the kitchen, pull the dishes from the sink
And you have changed in the blink of an eye
Something you see wakes you up from the dream
Wanna go back to sleep but now you're up from the dream
Walk into the kitchen, pull the dishes from the sink

But you want me like your crown
And it seemed your favorite thing to do
Was to keep me in the dark and turned around

You can wave your sayings like a flag
You can wave high over your head
You can sing your song to bring me again

Have dimmed too much

There was a moment, you and I
We saw it stretch across our lives
Thinking we could make it if we tried
And now this car won't drive this road
There are some things I should've known
There are some things on my mind
But I won't pick up the line

'Cause I don't have the heart to admit
I don't wanna finish what we started
I think you could be an honest man
But I'm a woman who's just too guarded
We know it's a big mistake
Like the other ones we made
Nothing left to do but let it lie
Let's not wait till water's running dry

Now I don't wanna compromise
'Cause, baby, both of us have tried
You know it hurts me letting go
It hurts me more than I can show
I close my eyes, see an open road
There are some things I wanna know
There are some things on my mind
But I don't know how to see it right

'Cause I don't have the heart to admit
I don't wanna finish what we started
I think you could be an honest man
But I'm a woman who's just too guarded
We know it's a big mistake
Like the other ones we made
Nothing left to do but let it lie
Let's not wait till water's running dry

Don't wait up for me
I'm not coming home
I'm not tired
Gonna drive all night
Don't wait up for me
I'm not answering my phone
I'm headed north on the  till it's light
Don't wait for me, don't wait for me
Might not hear from me for a while

'Cause I don't have the heart to admit
We can never finish what we started

What was always there in our eyes

Host: How does it work? Does someone come up with one idea for the song or like a like catchy line or a hook or something and then everyone adds in? Or is it just kind of you write it with a guitar and-
Danielle: Well this song is really special like, really special because I think we were in the studio and kind of, you know, having, trying to finish The Wire like we said and just like trying to finish these songs that we had had, that we have had for years. We were like I really just wanna just get my mind off of it and just try something new."" And we kind of came up with some chords and like, kind of made like a drum track.

Alana: Yeah that's the only thing that they know because like the words, there's so many words and you like look into the crowd and everyone's like trying to mouth the words but it's like so fast that they can't do it. And then right comes around and it's like Yeah! Right!"" But, um yeah that song definitely, that was the hard- that is the hardest song we've ever recorded. I think that's gonna be the hardest song we've ever recorded, but it was a good journey and now we're here.
Alana: Recordingwise, we kind of like doing things um, we just like adding new things that you wouldn't really necessarily hear live, I think which is cool, I mean in the studio-
Danielle: I think we always had this idea- like the way that it turned out was always the idea we had behind it and that's why recording it- when we recorded it live, it just didn't feel like, um what's the word? When we recorded it just live in a room, it just felt like something was missing. And like, you know, we heard like, kind of like snaps and like claps and like, you know things that maybe I guess are a little more poppier."

Host: And we're going to talk through your album Days Are Gone, track by track
All: Yes
Host: So the album when it started I thought that something was broken with the computer. I was like Is there like a movie trailer thing or something like that? Is there like an advert on my youtube somewhere?"" like what's going on?
Este: That was the idea I think behind it. We wanted it to sound like the beginning of Jurassic Park, like there were velociraptors coming into your house.
Alana: Like you know the scene where there's like a glass of water and it just ripples? Yeah that's what we wanted the beginning to sound like.
Este: Because the Trex is coming. That's what we wanted it to sound like.
Host: Was it hard like deciding which track to put first as the opener?
Danielle: It was, just cuz we didn't know like what kind of vibe. And then it just, I think we were kind of having a listening party and were like Why don't we just start with falling?"" because it kind of puts you in a mood I think.
Alana: Yeah, start the party- track one
Este: Something you can count on, you know? Familiarity.
Alana: This was kind of like the first song we knew for a fact was gonna be on the record. So like when I think about Falling, I like think about like a year ago when we started.
Danielle: I think my favorite part was when we figured out the outro. Este just kind of went into the booth and we were like Riff, Este! Just go!"" and she just like she like vocal jammed for like-
Este: Yeah, I'm the vocal jam lap dog. They do they do things, they tell me to do things and I do them.
Alana: Go in there, Este. You go."" imitates whip cracking sounds* Get in there"" imitates more whip cracking sounds* Get in the vocal booth""
Danielle: And I remember coming, she came up with this like chant at the chant at the end the never look back never give up"" and we were like wait that's like really good and then just like we ended the-
Alana: And Este walked out and brushed her shoulders off
Este: Yeah no biggie

Este: It goes: , , , 
Danielle: The next, My Song , My- Unless you name it something, and for me, whenever I'm making, we're making or just writing and not making any specific idea or we don't have an idea for a lyric it kinda. Like, it's weird to kind of name a song before you even create anything.
All: Yeah.
Danielle: So, once we got to My Song , we kind of created this weird melody with these weird drums and just kind of brainstormed a bunch of different ideas on this one session. And I remember bringing it to Ariel and I was like There's something to this, I don't know what but there's all these kind of random parts but I think they can work together."" And we worked on it and it just always stayed My Song . We never changed-
Alana: Everyone was like What is My Song 's name?"" and we were like My Song .""
Danielle: We were like we don't know- it just always felt that it should just be called that, just because it is- There's so many different parts and it kind of just sounds like a demo and we used a lot of the sounds from the demo. Like, there's a part where I say Honey I'm not you're honey pie."" and that's literally me in my living room on Garageband with like a weird CD like stuck in- like you can hear like the weird humming from the CD, like my stuck CD in my laptop. Like, you know, we used a lot of the Garageband sounds on that. It just seemed like we should keep it My Song .
Este: That was a fun one to record too.
Alana and Danielle: Yeah.
Danielle: Just cuz we were, we wanted to keep the demoish quality of it but kind of amp it up."

It got remixed because-
Host: Yeah. it definitely sounds slightly different.
Danielle: Yeah. And I think, you know, there's some new vocals on it because when we first recorded it, we recorded it in like, a closet essentially. You know, with like a little live room-
Danielle: So all the drums are just stored in- So we kind of, we messed with it, but it was one of those songs where we were like You know what? We can't recreate what we made, you know, two years ago""
Danielle: Forever is probably one of our most kind of important songs, I think, cuz it kind of started everything for us so-
Alana: It was the most important song that almost got thrown away.
Este and Danielle: Yeah.
Este: That we almost didn't record.
Alana: Yeah, we almost didn't record it. It was, we had been playing forever for forever.
Everyone: laughs*
Alana: No, for I think like two years or something. And like, every time we played it, it was like really different, it was like half time.
Danielle: It was slower.
Alana: It was really slower- it was really slower. It was way slower.
Danielle: I remember coming to the studio with a kick and a snare and a hi hat, that's all we had. And he had this little live room, and again, like there was just, we set up a couple mics and I just like played for five minutes. And then we just like blew it out, we just like distorted the sht out of the drums because the mics were so bad. And like I think we added like a sub kick like just triggered one and then like we like kind of had this like upbeat track.  And I was like Wait maybe this could work?"" and it totally did. Like we literally for like four days just kind of messed with it and it was the most excited thing that we recorded just because we weren't really thinking about it And we-
Alana: Yeah, Forever was the first song that we could play in our car for more than three seconds.
Danielle: Yeah, before when we would record stuff, we'd like play it in the car and like we couldn't listen to it, cuz we get just like kind of embarrassed about it like wait, this is us and it's weird."" But, Forever was the first thing we were like wait I wanna play this""
Este and Alana: Yeah

Alana: Yeah.
Danielle: Um, but we never really, I don't know why we never really wrote on piano but this is kind of like the first one where we had this piano line and it just felt kind of like a closer for some reason.
Alana: We put like blood, sweat, and tears into the last song. It was kind of like the end of this long, long recording process and we had such a crazy year this year and um, with Running If You Call My Name every time we played it it kind of just felt like you could- at least for us, every time I listen to it I can like feel all like the craziness that we went through and all the fun times and all like the really stressful times we went through. It's just like this big release every time I hear it and it just felt like such a good closer cuz it was the end for us.

That was it, just kind of like a release. It was, and we had written that like at the very, very end, it was like the last thing.

And I love, every time I listen to this song it's just so, I just love, I could listen to it over and over and over again cuz it's just, it's so crazy to hear what we came up with on that one. Touring really inspired us this year cuz all we want, I mean we've been a band for six years, almost seven years and all we wanted to do was tour and we could never do that cuz we couldn't get out of LA, we couldn't, you know we didn't have money, we couldn't do things. This year we got asked to be on so many amazing tours and meet so many amazing people and we would come back from tours, we'd have like a month and we'd just be so inspired. I think touring just, really inspired us the most out of everything, I think you can hear it in the new songs.
Alana: Yeah, it's just been the best year. I mean, we literally like we've played every kind of venue. We've played every living room, every parking lot. Every like, every time we would play at :. We'd play before the opener of the opener of the opener.
Este: We'd play as, as people were coming in we'd be like Thank you for coming to the show, here's another song. Thank- yes, ten, ten dollars at the door.""
Alana: Yeah, yeah. We had like a hat out.
Este: Yeah, basically busking.
Alana: And so, yeah I mean, we're just really grateful and super lucky that we get to do this. And that we even, you know, can put out a record cuz that's all we wanted to do. I mean, we've played live so many times and all we wanted to do was record our debut record.

Alana: Um, yeah Go Slow was the last song on the Forever EP and with that song, um we had just the track for like a year before we put any melody on it. We just had the guitar line, the do do do do do do do do."" And um, we always liked adding things to it. We had this like, full demo and just, it didn't have a melody on it and we wrote a full song over it. And kinda sounded like it didn't really seem right and it was like done. Everything, there was like a verse, chorus, everything. And then, finally we were just like We need to just rewrite it."" And we never really did that. It's really hard to have a full song and kind of be set in your ways and to realize like okay, it's not right. You have to rewrite the whole thing cuz you just keep playing the same melody in your head so it's kind of hard to get away from it. We finally just sat down and like erased everything and started over and went with like a more simpler melody-
Este: Yeah.
Alana: We were just like It needs to have space"" because the guitar line needs to have room. And then Go Slow kinda came about and that's what happened.
Host: Is it also the original recordings from the EP just remixed?
Danielle and Alana: Yeah.
Danielle: That was one of the ones that we tried to kind of mess with-
Alana: Rerecord.

Host: Why did the Don't Save Me album take so long, Haim?"" Alana with her organ!""
Este: Yeah, yeah, exactly.
Alana: Alana took five years to record her organ part!"" Um, but yeah that song was really fun, at least really fun to record for me because I got to, it was kind of like I got to try out so many keyboards and organs for the background part. But, um yeah with that song it was just really important for us to keep it live and not really screw it up, just screw around with it cuz I think it's just really straight forward.
Host: It's the drums part you play live as well?
Danielle: Yeah, it's not on the record because we feel like-
Alana: Well we just like, we keep, we like to change up the drum part every time we play it and we didn't really want to put it, I'd rather it be a surprise every time and not just like on the record. It's kind of like yeah just always, that part always evolves. And so yeah it's just not, it's more of a live surprise than a record surprise.

All: Yeah.
Host: Just turn it up a bit louder. Save yourself twenty quid or whatever.
Alana: Yeah.
Este: Right?
Host: But you get to be more, you know, experimental in the studio, put in different sounds, turn the songs into something else and then when you play them live, you can do the same thing in a different way.

Want You Back - Recorded at Spotify Studios NYC,Haim,Spotify Singles,"{'year': 2017, 'month': 1, 'day': 1}","Some things are long forgotten
Some things were never said
We were on one endless road
But I had a wandering heart

I said we were opposite lovers
Said it from the beginning
You kept trying to prove me wrong
Said you'd always see it through
And I know that I ran you down
So you ran away with your heart

But just know that I want you back
Just know that I want you back
Just know that I want you
Ill take the fall and the fault in us
I'll give you all the love I never gave before I left you
Just know that I want you back
Just know that I want you back
Just know that I want you
I'll take the fall and the fault in us
Ill give you all the love I never gave before I left you

I know it's hard to hear it
And it may never be enough
But don't take it out on me now
'Cause I blame it all on myself

And I had a fear of forgiveness
Said it from the beginning
I was too proud to say I was wrong
Said you'd always see me through
All that time is gone, no more fearing control
I'm ready for the both of us now

So just know that I want you back
Just know that I want you back
Just know that I want you
I'll take the fall and the fault in us
I'll give you all the love I never gave before I left you
Just know that I want you back
Just know that I want you)
Just know that I want you back
Just know that I want you)
Just know that I want you
Ill take the fall and the fault in us
Ill give you all the love I never gave before I left you
Just know that I want you back, baby)
Just know that I want you back
Just know that I want you back
Just know that I want you
I'll take the fall and the fault in us
Ill give you all the love I never gave before I left you
Just know that I want you back
Just know that I want you back
Just know that I want you
I'll take the fall and the fault in us
I'll give you all the love I never gave before I left you

Just know that I want you back
Just know that I want you back
Just know that I want you

Now I know you're going
You just threw this away
You know I ain't gonna take it, go slow
But we ain't gonna make it, I know
I can't make you stay
But I'll be hurting from the heat
Heat, heat, heat, heat, heat
Heat, heat, heat, heat, heat
Heat, heat
Hurting from the heat
Heat, heat, heat, heat, heat
Heat, heat, heat, heat, heat
Heat, heat
Well, well, was it something that I said?
I know that it was something I said)
From your heat now
Going crazy, trying hard to forget
You know I'm trying hard to forget)
From your heat now
I just want to go back, hold on
To the way that I was
'Cause you took away all my young life
And I hate who I've become
From your heat now
From the heat it's coming, coming
I know
I'm giving in and believing every lie
For now the moon is night
I turned off the light
When you shook up the foundation, go slow
With your intimidation, I know
Oh when you turn away now
I'll be hurting from the heat
Heat, heat, heat, heat, heat
Heat, heat, heat, heat, heat
Heat, heat
Hurting from the heat
Heat, heat, heat, heat, heat
Heat, heat, heat, heat, heat

Home (Mixed),Haim,Barbie: Live from the Barbie Dream House (DJ Mix),"{'year': 2023, 'month': 7, 'day': 28}","You think you know about me, well, I know me better
I'm not the girl who waits around just to be walked all over
I never tread the line, I never fell and I never lied
But I never thought that I could be the one to open my eyes

I know that
We'll be looking back one day
But I trust that I
Could never stay the same
When everything felt so wrong
It led me to wherе I belong
So now
I'm going home
Take mе home, just take me home
Take me home

Home is a symphony and it's bittersweet when it's callin' me
Just another river deep, flowing to an ocean
I know that I may never know; the future, unpredictable
A hundred choices led me here, lessons learned with every tear
They take me home, take me home
Take me home, take me home
Hold it inside my heart
Just take me home

I know that
We'll be looking back one day
But I trust that I
Could never stay the same
When everything felt so wrong
It led me to where I belong
So now Now, now)
I'm going home
Take me home, just take me home
Take me home

Looking back on my life
The past is a mirror
I've left and come back
But what am I closer to? I know that)
But what am I closer to? We'll be looking back one day)
What am I closer to? I hope that we)
What am I closer to? Will never be the same)

I know that
We'll be looking back one day
But I trust that I I trust that I)
I could never stay the same I could never stay the same)
When everything felt so wrong
It led me to where I belong
So now Now, now)
I'm going home
Take me home, just take me home
Take me home
Home is a symphony and it's bittersweet when it's callin' me
Just another river deep, flowing to an ocean
I know that I may never know; the future, unpredictable
A hundred choices led me here, lessons learned with every tear

They take me home, take me home
Take me home, take me home
I hold it inside my heart
Just take me home"
