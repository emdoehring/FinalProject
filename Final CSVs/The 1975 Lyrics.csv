Love It If We Made It,The 1975,A Brief Inquiry Into Online Relationships,"{'year': 2018, 'month': 7, 'day': 19}","We're fucking in a car, shooting heroin

Sincerity Is Scary,The 1975,A Brief Inquiry Into Online Relationships,"{'year': 2018, 'month': 9, 'day': 13}","And irony is okay, I suppose, culture is to blame
You try and mask your pain in the most postmodern way
You lack substance when you say something like, Oh, what a shame""
It's just a selfreferential way that stops you having to be human
I'm assuming you'll balloon when you remove the dirty spoon
And start consuming like a human, that's what I am assuming

I'm sure that you're not just another girl
I'm sure that you're gonna say that I was sexist
I feel like you're running out of all the things I liked you for

Why can't we be friends when we are lovers?
'Cause it always ends with us hating each other
Instead of calling me out, you should be pulling me in
I've just got one more thing to say

And why would you believe you could control how you're perceived
When at your best, you're intermediately versed in your own feelings?
Keep on putting off conceiving, it's only you that you're deceiving
Oh, don't have a child, don't cramp your style, I'll leave it

Why can't we be friends when we are lovers?
'Cause it always ends with us hating each other
Instead of calling me out, you should be pulling me in
I've just got one more thing to say

After your show when you let go of my hand
In front of some sket who wanted bit on your—

She blazed about how cultural language is an operating system
A simple interface rendered feeble and listless
When tested with divinity or a true understanding of the human condition
I never did understand, the duality of art and reality, living life and treating it as such but with a certain disconnect
To touch that cajoles at the artist with comfort and abandon, and between the spires and rolling roofs of the white city
That orange, English light cast only one, singular shadow

Give Yourself a Try,The 1975,A Brief Inquiry Into Online Relationships,"{'year': 2018, 'month': 5, 'day': 31}","You learn a couple things when you get to my age
Like friends don't lie and it all tastes the same in the dark
When your vinyl and your coffee collection is a sign of the times
You're getting spiritually enlightened at twentynine

So just give yourself a try
Won't you give yourself a try?
Won't you give yourself a try?
Won't you give?

I found a grey hair in one of my zoots
Like context in a modern debate, I just took it out
The only apparatus required for happiness is your pain and fucking going outside
And getting STDs at twentyseven really isn't the vibe
Jane took her own life at sixteen
She was a kid who had the box tattooed on her arm
And I was twentyfive and afraid to go outside
A millennial that baby boomers like

Won't you give yourself a try?
Won't you give yourself a try?
Won't you give yourself a try?
Won't you give?

And what would you say to your younger self?
Growing a beard's quite hard and whiskey never starts to taste nice
And you'll make a lot of money, and it's funny
'Cause you'll move somewhere sunny and get addicted to drugs
And spend obscene amounts on fucking seeds and beans online

So just give yourself a try
Won't you give yourself a try?
Won't you give yourself a try?
Won't you give?"

One day, the man, whose name was snowflakesmasher, turned to his friend, the Internet, and he said, Internet, do you love me?"" The Internet looked at him and said, Yes.

Yeah 
Jag tänker det här, det hör inte riktigt hemma här
We are right now in the beginning of a climate and ecological crisis
And  we need to call it what it is
An  emergency
We must acknowledge that we do not have the situation under control
And  that we don't have all the solutions yet
Unless those solutions mean that we simply stop doing certain things
We must admit that we are losing this battle
We have to acknowledge that the older generations have failed
All  political movements in their present form have failed
But Homo sapiens have not yet failed
Yes, we are failing, but there is still time to turn everything around
We can still fix this
We still have everything in our own hands
But unless we recognise the overall failures of our current systems
We most probably don't stand a chance
We are facing a disaster of unspoken sufferings for enormous amounts of people
And now is not the time for speaking politely or focusing on what we can or cannot say
Now is the time to speak clearly
Solving the climate crisis is the greatest and most complex challenge that Homo sapiens have ever faced
The main solution, however, is so simple that even a small child can understand it
We have to stop our emissions of greenhouse gases
And either we do that, or we don't
You say that nothing in life is black or white
But that is a lie, a very dangerous lie
Either we prevent a . degree of warming, or we don't
Either we avoid setting off that irreversible chain reaction beyond human control, or we don't
Either we choose to go on as our civilization, or we don't
That is as black or white as it gets
Because there are no grey areas when it comes to survival
Now, we all have a choice
We can create transformational action that will safeguard the living conditions for future generations
Or we can continue with our business as usual and fail
That is up to you and me
And yes, we need a system change rather than individual change
But you cannot have one without the other
If you look through history
All the big changes in society have been started by people at the grassroots level
People like you and me
So, I ask you to please wake up and make the changes required possible
To do your best is no longer good enough
We must all do the seemingly impossible
Today, we use about  million barrels of oil every single day
There are no politics to change that
There are no rules to keep that oil in the ground
So, we can no longer save the world by playing by the rules
Because the rules have to be changed
Everything needs to change, and it has to start today
So, everyone out there, it is now time for civil disobedience
It is time to rebel"

Ah, but that's the thing, it's not even really about fuck Donald Trump, that's the thing. It's not even that..
We've been in America for like, three months during the election and we were in the UK during Brexit so we fucking picked our time in this year. But that's not, that's kind of not the rhetoric that's needed cause I was so angry and I know, look at- We see loads of young, liberal, compassionate people every night so this is like our world, this is the world that we see. So when things go at odds of that, it's really confusing and it's really fucking- It makes you really angry and the thing is, I know it's very sad to see all of these young voices of progression and change being drowned out by regressive ideals and bullshit. It's very sad. And it appears to be paradigms of race and it is about that, and it is about gender, and it is about age, and it is about sexuality, but it's also about a lot of these people that voted against for what we stand for
They feel so so disenfranchised by both sides of political systems that that felt like the right thing to do. So if we're young, right? And we're liberal, and we're compassionate, and we're Muslim and we're black, and we're gay, and we're whatever.

Charlatan telepathy exploiting insecurity and praying on the purity
Of grief and its simplicity but I know that maybe I'm too skeptical

And I'm trying to progress, but instead of selling sex..

I am forever in alongside the boys in jumpers
On bikes from schools and cars
With autumn leaves fallen sparse across the midafternoon
She blazed about how Cultural language is an operating system
A simple interface rendered feeble and listless
When tested with divinity or a true understanding of the human condition
I never did understand – the duality of art and reality – living life and treating it as such but with a certain disconnect to touch that cajoles at the artist with comfort and abandon
And between the rolling roofs and spires of the white city
That orange, English light cast only one, singular shadow
For you are not beside but within me

She blazed about how cultural language is an operating system
A simple interface rendered feeble and listless
When tested with divinity or a true understanding of the human condition
I never did understand – the duality of art and reality – living life and treating it as such but with a certain disconnect
To touch that cajoles at the artist with comfort and abandon, and between the spires and rolling roofs of the white city
That orange, English light cast only one, singular shadow Let's do it!)

Push your lack of chest out
Look at my hair
Gotta love the way you love yourself
Your obsession with rocks and brown
And fucking the whole town's a reflection on your mental health

'Cause I remember when I found you
Much younger than you are now
And once we startеd having friends 'round
You created a tеlevision of your mouth
