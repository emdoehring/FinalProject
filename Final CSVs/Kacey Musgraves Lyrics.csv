Rainbow,Kacey Musgraves,Golden Hour,"{'year': 2019, 'month': 2, 'day': 11}","When it rains, it pours
But you didn't even notice
It ain't rainin' anymore
It's hard to breathe when all you know is
The struggle of stayin' above the risin' water line

Well, the sky has finally opened
The rain and wind stopped blowin'
But you're stuck out in the same ol' storm again
You hold tight to your umbrella
Well, darlin', I'm just tryin' to tell ya
That there's always been a rainbow
Hangin' over your head

If you could see what I see
You'd be blinded by the colors
Yellow, red, and orange, and green
And at least a million others
So tie up the boat, take off your coat
And take a look around

'Cause the sky has finally opened
The rain and wind stopped blowin'
But you're stuck out in the same ol' storm again
You hold tight to your umbrella
Well, darlin', I'm just tryin' to tell ya
That there's always been a rainbow
Hangin' over your head

Oh, tie up the boat, take off your coat
And take a look around
Everything is alright now

'Cause the sky has finally opened
The rain and wind stopped blowin'
But you're stuck out in the same ol' storm again
Let go of your umbrella
'Cause, darlin', I'm just tryin' to tell ya
That there's always been a rainbow
Hangin' over your head
Yeah, there's always been a rainbow
Hangin' over your head

Mmm
It'll all be alright"
Butterflies,Kacey Musgraves,Golden Hour,"{'year': 2018, 'month': 2, 'day': 23}","I was just coastin', never really goin' anywhere
Caught up in a web, I was gettin' kinda used to stayin' there
And out of the blue
I fell for you

Now, you're lifting me up 'stead of holding me down
Stealing my heart 'stead of stealing my crown
Untangled all the strings 'round my wings that were tied
I didn't know him and I didn't know me
Cloud Nine was always out of reach
Now, I remember what it feels like to fly
You give me butterflies

Kiss full of color makes me wonder where you've always been
I was hiding in doubt 'til you brought me out of my chrysalis
And I came out new
All because of you

And now, you're lifting me up 'stead of holding me down
Stealing my heart 'stead of stealing my crown
Untangled all the strings 'round my wings that were tied
I didn't know him and I didn't know me
Cloud Nine was always out of reach
Now, I remember what it feels like to fly
You give me butterflies, yeah
You give me butterflies

Ooh, mm, mm

Now, you're lifting me up 'stead of holding me down
You're taking my hand 'stead of taking my crown
Untangled all the strings 'round my wings that were tied
I didn't know him and I didn't know me
Cloud Nine was always out of reach
Now, I remember what it feels like to fly
You give me butterflies Mm)
You give me butterflies Mm)"
Slow Burn,Kacey Musgraves,Golden Hour,"{'year': 2018, 'month': 3, 'day': 30}","Born in a hurry, always late
Haven't been early since '
Texas is hot, I can be cold
Grandma cried when I pierced my nose
Good in a glass, good on green
Good when you're puttin' your hands all over me

I'm alright with a slow burn
Taking my time, let the world turn
I'm gonna do it my way, it'll be alright
If we burn it down and it takes all night
It's a slow burn, yeah

In Tennessee, the sun's goin' down
But in Beijing, they're headin' out to work
You know the bar down the street don't close for an hour
We should take a walk and look at all the flowers

'Cause I'm alright with a slow burn
Taking my time, let the world turn
I'm gonna do it my way, it'll be alright
If we burn it down and it takes all night
It's a slow burn

Mm, whatever feels good
Ah, ah, ah, ah
Mm

Old soul, waitin' my turn
I know a few things, but I still got a lot to learn
So I'm alright with a slow burn, slow burn, slow burn
Mm, I'm alright with a slow burn"
Golden Hour,Kacey Musgraves,Golden Hour,"{'year': 2018, 'month': 3, 'day': 30}","All that I know
Is you caught me at the right time
Keep me in your glow
'Cause I'm having such a good time
With you

Baby, don't you know?
That you're my golden hour
The color of my sky
You've set my world on fire
And I know, I know everything's gonna be alright

I used to get sad
And lonely when the sun went down
But it's different now
'Cause I love the light that I've found
In you

Baby, don't you know?
That you're my golden hour
The color of my sky
You've set my world on fire
And I know, I know everything's gonna be alright

You make the world look beautiful, ooh
I thought I'd seen it all before
But looking through your eyes
It looks like paradise

You've set my world on fire, yeah
And I know, I know everything's gonna be alright
You're my golden hour

Space Cowboy,Kacey Musgraves,Golden Hour,"{'year': 2018, 'month': 2, 'day': 23}","You look out the window while I look at you
Saying I don't know would be like saying that the sky ain't blue
And boots weren't made for sitting by the door
Since you don't wanna stay anymore

You can have your space, cowboy
I ain't gonna fence you in
Go on, ride away in your Silverado
Guess I'll see you 'round again
I know my place, and it ain't with you
Well sunsets fade, and love does, too
Yeah, we had our day in the sun
When a horse wants to run, there ain't no sense in closing the gate
You can have your space, cowboy

After the gold rush, there ain't no reason to stay
Shoulda learned from the movies that good guys don't run away
But roads weren't made to not go down
And there ain't room for both of us in this town

So you can have your space, cowboy
I ain't gonna fence you in
Go on, ride away in your Silverado
I'll see you around again
'Cause I know my place, and it ain't with you
Sunsets fade, and love does, too
We had our day in the sun
When a horse wants to run, ain't no sense in closing the gate
So you can have your space

You can have your space, cowboy
I ain't gonna fence you in
Go on, ride away in your Silverado
I'll see you around again
'Cause I know my place, and it ain't with you
Sunsets fade, and love does, too
Though we had our day in the sun
When a horse wants to run, ain't no sense in closing the gate
You can have your space
Yeah, you can have your space
You can have your space, cowboy"
Deeper Well,Kacey Musgraves,Deeper Well,"{'year': 2024, 'month': 2, 'day': 8}","My Saturn has returned
When I turned twentyseven
Everything started to change
Took a long time, but I learned
There's two kinds of people, one is a giver
And one's always tryin' to take
All they can take

So I'm sayin' goodbye to the people that I feel
Are real good at wastin' my time
No regrets, baby, I just think that maybe
You go your way and I'll go mine
It's been a real good time
But you got dark energy, somethin' I can't unsee
And I've got to take care of myself
I found a deeper well

I used to wake and bake
Roll out of bed, hit the gravity bong that I made
And start the day
For a while it got me by
Everything I did seemed better when I was high
I don't know why

So I'm gettin' rid of the habits that I feel
Are real good at wastin' my time
No regrets, baby, I just think that maybe
It's natural when things lose their shine
So other things can glow
I've gotten older now, I know
How to take care of myself
I found a deeper well
Mm

When I was growing up
We had what we needed, shoes on our feet
But the world was as flat as a plate
And that's okay

The things I was taught only took me so far
Had to figure the rest out myself
And then I found
I found a deeper well

Come Sunday morning you best be
There in the front row, like you're s'posed to

Same hurt in every heart
Same trailer, different park
Mama's hooked on Mary Kay
Brother's hooked on Mary Jane
And Daddy's hooked on Mary two doors down
Mary, Mary, quite contrary
We get bored so we get married
And just like dust, we settle in this town
On this broken merry go 'round
And 'round and 'round we go
Where it stops, nobody knows
And it ain't slowin' down
This merry go 'round

We think the first time's good enough
So we hold on to high school love
Say we won't end up like our parents
Tiny little boxes in a row
Ain't what you want, it's what you know
Just happy in the shoes you're wearin'

Same checks we're always cashin'
To buy a little more distraction

'Cause Mama's hooked on Mary Kay
Brother's hooked on Mary Jane
And Daddy's hooked on Mary two doors down

And Mary had a little lamb

The way that you've got me lit up inside
It's the song that they're playin', the words that you're sayin'
It's never felt so right

And I'm the kind of person who starts getting kinda nervous
When I'm having the time of my life

Is there a word for the way that I'm feeling tonight?
Happy and sad at the same time
You got me smiling with tears in my eyes
I never felt so high
No, I've never been this far off of the ground
And they say everything that goes up must come down
But I don't wanna come down

So is there a way to stop all this thinkin', just keep on drinkin'?
'Cause I don't wanna wake up
When they're turnin' the lights on and it turns out the joke's on me
'Cause it feels so right

And I'm the kind of person who starts getting kinda nervous

No, I've never been this far off of the ground
And they say everything that goes up must come down
But I don't wanna come down

I don't mind at all, no, I'm used to fallin'
I'm comfortable when the sky is gray
But when everything is perfect, I start hidin'
'Cause I know that rain is comin' my way, my way

Lie the answers and a path for you
Dive down deep into her sound
But not too far or you'll be drowned

She will sing to those who'll hear
And in her song, all magic flows
But can you brave what you most fear?
Can you face what the river knows?

Until the river's finally crossed
You'll never feel the solid ground
You had to get a little lost
On your way to being found

Oh, I can feel it, magic in your fingertips
And I can hear it in the words coming off your lips

Didn't know it was a simple time

Put my lip gloss on
Kick it at the mall like there's nothin' wrong
I need to step away
If I don't, I'm gonna go insane 'cause
Being grown up kind of sucks and I'm
Really just missing the simple times, uhhuh

I wanna wake up on an island
Throw еverybody a peace sign
Put all thе static on silent

Pour one out for the simple times

Me dio dos luceros que cuando los abro
Perfecto distingo lo negro del blanco
Y en el alto cielo, su fondo estrellado
Y en las multitudes, el hombre que yo amo

Gracias a la vida que me ha dado tanto
Me ha dado el oído que en todo su ancho
Cada noche y día, grillos y canarios
Martillos, turbinas, ladridos, chubascos
Y la voz tan tierna de mi bien amado

Gracias a la vida que me ha dado tanto
Me ha dado el sonido y el abecedario
Con él, las palabras que pienso y declaro
Madre, amigo, hermano y luz alumbrando
La ruta del alma del que estoy amando

Gracias a la vida que me ha dado tanto
Me ha dado la marcha de mis pies cansados
Con ellos anduve ciudades y charcos
Playas y desiertos, montañas y llanos
Y la casa tuya, tu calle y tu patio

Gracias a la vida que me ha dado tanto
Me dio el corazón que agita su marco
Cuando miro el fruto del cerebro humano
Cuando miro el bueno tan lejos del malo
Cuando miro el fondo de tus ojos claros

Gracias a la vida que me ha dado tanto
Me ha dado la risa y me ha dado el llanto
Así yo distingo dicha de quebranto
Los dos materiales que forman mi canto
Y el canto de ustedes que es el mismo canto
Y el canto de todos que es mi propio canto

The Architect,Kacey Musgraves,Deeper Well,"{'year': 2024, 'month': 3, 'day': 15}","Even something as small as an apple
It's simple and somehow complex
Sweet and divine, the perfect design
Can I speak to the architect?
There's a canyon that cuts through the desert
Did it get there because of a flood?
Was it devised or were you surprised
When you saw how grand it was?

Was it thought out at all or just paint on a wall?
Is there anything that you regret?
I don't understand, are there blueprints or plans?
Can I speak to the architect?

Somеtimes, I look in the mirror
And wish I could make a rеquest
Could I pray it away, am I shapeable clay?
Or is this as good as it gets?
One day, you're on top of a mountain
So high that you'll never come down
Then the wind at your back carries ember and ash
That burns your whole house to the ground

Is it thought out at all or just paint on a wall?
Is there anything that you regret?
I don't understand, are there blueprints or plans?
Can I speak to the architect?

I thought that I was too broken
And maybe too hard to love
I was in a weird place, then I saw the right face
And the stars and the planets lined up

Does it happen by chance, is it all happenstance?
Do we have any say in this mess?
Is it too late to make some more space?
Can I speak to the architect?
This life that we make, is it random or fate?
Can I speak to the architect?
Is there an architect?"

And you've almost given up
Hold on tight despite the way they make you mad
'Cause you might not even know that you don't have it so bad

A pretty face
It might get you far, but still, it can't replace
The kind of real connection that I crave
The kind we don't have anymore
And I get in my head
Analyzing what I had
It's a chapter that ain't coming back
I coulda learned to love it more

The layers and ruffles in my favorite pink champagne cake
My home state of Texas
The sky there, the horses and dogs
But none of their laws

Thе shape of his eyes
Thе shape of his nose
The cute way he mispronounces certain words
The smell of his clothes
The things I would miss
From the other side
Mm

Intimate convos that go way into the night
The way that the sun on my floor makes a pattern of light
And early in June, when the fireflies first start to glow, it never gets old

The shape of his heart
And my shoes by his door
He loves me in all of the ways that I've never felt love before
Things I would miss
From the other side

You're cozy in your little room
The carpet's all paid for, God bless the TV
Let's go shoot a hole in the moon

Oh, and Roy Rogers is riding tonight

Evergreen heroes whose stories were told
Oh, the great sequin cowboy who sings of the plains
Of roundups and rustlers and home on the range
Turn on the TV, shut out the lights
Roy Rogers is riding tonight

Nine o'clock mornings, and five o'clock evenings
I'd liven up the pace if I could
Oh, I'd rather have a ham on my sandwich than cheese
But complaining wouldn't do you no good
So I laid my chair, close my eyes and think clear
I can hear hoofbeats ahead
'Cause Roy and Trigger have just hit the hilltop
And everyone else is in bed

Oh, and Roy Rogers is riding tonight
Returning to our silver screens

Would she sing another holiday ditty that's overplayed in cafes and shopping mall restrooms?
And most importantly, would more celebrity friends continue to make surprise appearances that everyone sees coming but Kacey?
I don't know
Dan Yes?)

Lots of cheer Okay)
You know, happy...
You know, you're funny and that's kinda why we hired you, so, you know

It just reminded me that
This isn't just some big corporate holiday, it's
It's also about being with the people you love
