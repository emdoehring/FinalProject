In the Aeroplane Over the Sea,Neutral Milk Hotel,In the Aeroplane Over the Sea,"{'year': 1998, 'month': 2, 'day': 10}","What a beautiful face
I have found in this place
That is circling all 'round the sun
What a beautiful dream
That could flash on the screen
In a blink of an eye and be gone from me
Soft and sweet
Let me hold it close and keep it here with me

And one day we will die
And our ashes will fly
From the aeroplane over the sea
But for now we are young
Let us lay in the sun
And count every beautiful thing we can see
Love to be
In the arms of all I'm keeping here with me

What a curious life
We have found here tonight
There is music that sounds from the street
There are lights in the clouds
Anna's ghost all around
Hear her voice as it's rolling and ringing through me
Soft and sweet
How the notes all bend and reach above the trees

Now how I remember you
How I would push my fingers through
Your mouth to make those muscles move
That made your voice so smooth and sweet
But now we keep where we don't know
All secrets sleep in winter clothes
With the one you loved so long ago
Now he don't even know his name

What a beautiful face
I have found in this place
That is circling all 'round the sun
And when we meet on a cloud
I'll be laughing out loud
I'll be laughing with everyone I see
Can't believe
How strange it is to be anything at all"
"Holland, 1945",Neutral Milk Hotel,In the Aeroplane Over the Sea,"{'year': 1998, 'month': 10, 'day': 13}","Two, one, two, three, four

The only girl I've ever loved
Was born with roses in her eyes
But then they buried her alive
One evening, 
With just her sister at her side
And only weeks before the guns
All came and rained on everyone
Now she's a little boy in Spain
Playing pianos filled with flames
On empty rings around the sun
All sing to say my dream has come

But now we must pack up every piece
Of the life we used to love
Just to keep ourselves
At least enough to carry on

And now we ride the circus wheel
With your dark brother wrapped in white
Says it was good to be alive
But now he rides a comet's flame
And won't be coming back again
The Earth looks better from a star
That's right above from where you are
He didn't mean to make you cry
With sparks that ring and bullets fly
On empty rings around your heart
The world just screams and falls apart

But now we must pack up every piece
Of the life we used to love
Just to keep ourselves
At least enough to carry on

And here's where your mother sleeps
And here is the room where your brothers were born
Indentions in the sheets
Where their bodies once moved but don't move anymore
And it's so sad to see the world agree
That they'd rather see their faces filled with flies
All when I'd want to keep white roses in their eyes"
Oh Comely,Neutral Milk Hotel,In the Aeroplane Over the Sea,"{'year': 1998, 'month': 2, 'day': 10}","Oh comely
I will be with you when you lose your breath
Chasing the only
Meaningful memory you thought you had left
With some pretty, bright and bubbly
Terrible scene that was doing her thing on your chest
But, oh comely
It isn't as pretty as you'd like to guess
In your memory, you're drunk on your awe to me
It doesn't mean anything at all

Oh comely
All of your friends are all letting you blow
Bristling and ugly
Bursting with fruits falling out from the holes
Of some pretty, bright and bubbly
Friend you could need to say comforting things in your ear
But, oh comely
There isn't such one friend that you could find here
Standing next to me, he's only my enemy
I'll crush him with everything I own

Say what you wanna say
And hang for your hollow ways
Moving your mouth to pull out all your miracles aimed
For me

Your father made fetuses with flesh licking ladies
While you and your mother were asleep in the trailer park
Thunderous sparks from the dark of the stadiums
The music and medicine you needed for comforting
So make all your fat fleshy fingers to moving
And pluck all your silly strings and bend all your notes for me
And soft silly music is meaningful magical
The movements were beautiful, all in your ovaries
All of them milking with green fleshy flowers
While powerful pistons were sugary sweet machines
Smelling of semen all under the garden
Was all you were needing when you still believed in me

Say what you wanna say
And hang for your hollow ways
Moving your mouth to pull out all your miracles aimed
For me

Do do do, do do do, do
Do do do, do do do, do
Do do do, do do do, do

I know they buried her body with others
Her sister and mother and fivehundred families
And will she remember me fifty years later?
I wished I could save her in some sort of time machine
Know all your enemies
We know who our enemies are
Know all your enemies
We know who our enemies are
Lalalala, lalala, lalalala, la la la la
Lalalala, lalala, lalalala, la la la la
Dee dee dee dee dee dee dee dee dee dee dee dee dee dee dee dee dee

Goldaline, my dear
We will fold and freeze together
Far away from here
There is sun and spring and green forever
But now we move to feel
For ourselves inside some stranger's stomach
Place your body here
Let your skin begin to blend itself with mine

Lalalala, lalala, lalalala, la la la la
Lalalala, lalala, lalalala, la la la la
Lalalala, lalala, lalalala
Dee dee dee dee dee dee dee dee dee dee dee dee dee dee dee dee dee
Holy shit!"""
"The King of Carrot Flowers, Pt. One",Neutral Milk Hotel,In the Aeroplane Over the Sea,"{'year': 1998, 'month': 2, 'day': 10}","When you were young, you were the king of carrot flowers
And how you built a tower tumbling through the trees
In holy rattlesnakes that fell all around your feet
And your mom would stick a fork right into daddy's shoulder
And dad would throw the garbage all across the floor
As we would lay and learn what each other's bodies were for

And this is the room one afternoon, I knew I could love you
And from above you how I sank into your soul
Into that secret place where no one dares to go
And your mom would drink until she was no longer speaking
And dad would dream of all the different ways to die
Each one a little more than he could dare to try"
Two-Headed Boy,Neutral Milk Hotel,In the Aeroplane Over the Sea,"{'year': 1998, 'month': 2, 'day': 10}","Twoheaded boy
All floating in glass
The sun, it has passed
Now it's blacker than black
I can hear as you tap on your jar
And I am listening to hear where you are
I am listening to hear where you are

Twoheaded boy
Put on Sunday shoes
And dance round the room to accordion keys
With the needle that sings in your heart
Catching signals that sound in the dark
Catching signals that sound in the dark

We will take off our clothes
And they'll be placing fingers
Through the notches in your spine
And when all is breaking
Everything that you could keep inside
Now your eyes ain't moving, now
They just lay there in their climb

Twoheaded boy
With pulleys and weights
Creating a radio played just for two
In the parlor with a moon across her face
And through the music he sweetly displays
Silver speakers that sparkle all day
Made for his lover who's floating and choking with her hands across her face

And in the dark we will take off our clothes
And they'll be placing fingers through the notches in your spine
And when all is breaking
Everything that you could keep inside
Now your eyes ain't moving, now
They just lay there in their climb

Twoheaded boy
There's no reason to grieve
The world that you need is wrapped in gold silver sleeves
Left beneath Christmas trees in the snow
And I will take you and leave you alone
Watching spirals of white softly flow
Over your eyelids and all you did
Will wait until the point when you let go"

I love you, Jesus Christ
Jesus Christ, I love you, yes I do
I love you, Jesus Christ
Jesus Christ, I love you, yes I do
And on the lazy days, the dogs dissolve and drain away
The world it goes and always waits
The day we are awaiting
Part Three

Up and over we go
Through the wave and undertow
I will float until I learn how to swim
Inside my mother in a garbage bin
Until I find myself again
Again, ohohohoh

Up and over we go
Mouths open wide and spitting snow
I will spit until I learn how to speak
Up through the doorway as the sideboards creak
With them ever proclaiming me
Me, oh

Up and over we go
The weight it sits on down and I don't know
I will shout until they know what I mean
I mean the marriage of a dead dog sing
And a synthetic flying machine
Machine, ohohohoh
Ohohohoh
Ohohohoh
Ohohohoh

Communist Daughter,Neutral Milk Hotel,In the Aeroplane Over the Sea,"{'year': 1998, 'month': 2, 'day': 10}","One

Sweet communist, the communist daughter
Standing on the seaweed water
Semen stains the mountain tops
Semen stains the mountain tops

With coca leaves along the border
Sweetness sings from every corner
Cars careening from the clouds
The bridges burst and twist around
And wanting something warm and moving
Bends towards herself, the soothing
Proves that she must still exist
She moves herself about her fist

Sweet communist, the communist daughter
Standing on the seaweed water
Semen stains the mountain tops
Semen stains the mountain tops

"Two-Headed Boy, Pt. Two",Neutral Milk Hotel,In the Aeroplane Over the Sea,"{'year': 1998, 'month': 2, 'day': 10}","Daddy, please hear this song that I sing
In your heart, there's a spark that just screams
For a lover to bring
A child to your chest that could lay as you sleep
And love all you have left, like your boy used to be
Long ago, wrapped in sheets warm and wet

Blister, please, with those wings in your spine
Love to be with a brother of mine
How he'd love to find
Your tongue in his teeth in a struggle to find
Secret songs that you keep wrapped in boxes so tight
Sounding only at night as you sleep

And in my dreams, you're alive and you're crying
As your mouth moves in mine, soft and sweet
Rings of flowers 'round your eyes and I'll love you
For the rest of your life when you're ready

Brother, see, we are one in the same
And you left with your head filled with flames
And you watched as your brains
Fell out through your teeth, push the pieces in place
Make your smile sweet to see, don't you take this away
I'm still wanting my face on your cheek

And when we break, we'll wait for our miracle
God is a place where some holy spectacle lies
When we break, we'll wait for our miracle
God is a place you will wait for the rest of your life

Twoheaded boy, she is all you could need
She will feed you tomatoes and radio wire
And retire to sheets, safe and clean
But don't hate her when she gets up to leave
creaking, guitar hitting floor, footsteps*"
Ghost,Neutral Milk Hotel,In the Aeroplane Over the Sea,"{'year': 1998, 'month': 2, 'day': 10}","Ghost, ghost, I know you live within me feel as you fly
In thunderclouds above the city into one that I
Love with all that was left within me til we tore in two
Now wings and rings and there's so many waiting here for you
And she was born in a bottlerocket in 
With wings that ringed around a socket right between her spine
All drenched in milk and holy water pouring from the sky
I know that she will live forever, she won't ever die

And she goes and now she knows she'll never be afraid
To watch the morning paper blow into a hole
Where noone can escape
Deeedeedeedeedeedee
Deeedeedeedeedeedee
Deeedeedeedeedeedee
Deeedeedeedeee

And one day in New York City, baby, a girl fell from the sky
From the top of a burning apartment building  stories high
And when her spirit left her body, how it split the sun
I know that she will live forever, all goes on and on and on

And she goes and now she knows she'll never be afraid
To watch the morning paper blow into a hole
Where noone can escape

Song Against Sex,Neutral Milk Hotel,On Avery Island,"{'year': 1996, 'month': 3, 'day': 26}","Huh?
Perfect. Its like, I know, like as far as the length of it and stuff and where you end it, it was exactly perfect

And the first one tore a picture
Of a dead and hanging man
Who was kissing foreign fishes
That flew right out from his hands
And when I put my arms around him
I felt the blushing blood run through my cheeks
And an eeriness surrounded
When his tongue began to speak
And he said, 'Oh boy you are so pretty
Enough to wrap tight in ricepaper string'
And when I finally kissed him
The whole world began to ring
Lost like a bell that's tipping over
With two cracks along both sides
And I knew the world was over
So I took a look outside
And watched the fires that were reaching
Up to the weather vanes and the tops of trees
And the waiting scene and the Sunday dream
They're all waiting here for me

Deli markets with their flower stands
And pretty girls and the burning men
Hanging out on the hooks next to the window displays
And I took out my tongue twice removed from my face
Across a bridge and across the mountains
Threw a nickel in a fountain
To save my soul from all these troubled times
And all the drugs that I don't have the guts to take
To soothe my mind so I'm always sober
Always aching, always heading towards
Mass suicide, occult figurines
And wasted gasstation attendants
Attending to their jobs
And a nice drive in the country
Finds a nice cliff to drop off
Oh when this life just gets so grating
All the grittiness of life
But don't take those pills your boyfriend gave you
You're too wonderful to die

And the last one tore a picture
From the pornographic page
When all the pleasure points attacking
All the looks of love were staged
And it's a lie that you've been given
That just hurts you every day
So why should I lay here naked
When it's just too far away
From anything we could call loving
Any love worth living for
So I'll sleep out in the gutter
You can sleep here on the floor
And when I wake up in the morning
I won't forget to lock the door
Because with a match that's mean and some gasoline
You won't see me anymore"

Naomi,Neutral Milk Hotel,On Avery Island,"{'year': 1996, 'month': 3, 'day': 26}","Your prettiness is seeping through
Out from the dress I took from you
So pretty
And my emptiness is swollen shut
Always a wretch I have become
So empty

And please please don't leave me

I'm watching Naomi, full bloom
I'm hoping she will soon explode
Into one billion tastes and tunes
One billion angels come and hold her down
They could hold her down until she cries

I'm tasting Naomi's perfume
It tastes like shit and I must say
She comes and goes most afternoons
One billion lovers wave and love her now
They could love her now and so could I

There is no Naomi in view
She walks through Cambridge stocks and strolls
And if she only really knew
One billion angels could come and save her soul
They could save her soul
Until she shines, until she shines
Until she shines, until she shines
Until she shines, until she shines

So pretty, so pretty
So pretty, so pretty
And please please don't leave me"

Gardenhead / Leave Me Alone,Neutral Milk Hotel,Beauty,"{'year': 1996, 'month': 3, 'day': 26}","
There are beads that wrap
Around your knees that crackle into the dark
Like a walk in the park
Like a hole in your head
Like the feeling you get when you realize you're dead
This time
We ride roller coasters into the ocean
We feel no emotion as we spiral down to the world
And I guess it's worth your time
Because there's some lives you live
And some you leave behind
It gets hard to explain
The gardenhead knows my name

Leave me alone
For you know this isn't the first time
In fact this is twice in a row
That the angels have slipped through our landslide
And filled up our garden with snow
And I don't wish to taste of your insides
Or to call out your name through my phone
For the glory boys at your bedside
Will love you as long as you're something to own
Will love you as long as you're something to own

Follow me through
A city of frost covered angels
I swear I have nothing to prove
I just want to dance in your tangles
To give me some reason to move
But to take on the world at all angles
Requires a strength I can't use
So I'll meet you up high in your anger
Of all that is hoping and waiting for you
Of all that is hoping and waiting for you"
April 8th,Neutral Milk Hotel,Unreleased Demo #2,"{'year': 1996, 'month': 3, 'day': 26}","Crawl across toward your window
I'm calling softly from the street
Always a lonely widow
Half awake and sleeping on my feet
I'm of age but have no children
No quarter phone booth calls to home
Just late night television
Inside my bedroom all alone

There is no use in waiting
Offer up your steps so I can climb
Show me all your figure paintings
Etched in the middle of the night
Let me stretch upon your carpet
Let me hear the rain tap on your street
Knowing I am safe on the inside
Blankets wrapped and drifting off to sleep"
Where You’ll Find Me Now,Neutral Milk Hotel,On Avery Island,"{'year': 1996, 'month': 3, 'day': 26}","All I perceive is wasted and broken
Silvery streams, sacred when spoken
Slam into me and into the ditch of debris
And you smoke in the park, you sleep in the greenery
Everyone barks and they are all still believing
To tear out your heart would send all your secrets to me

But I let you down
Swollen and small is where you'll find me now
With that silver stripping off
From my tongue you're tearing out
And you'll never hear me talk

Your teeth believe that teeth are for tearing
Tear into me, the scent of you sweating smells good to me
As long as we keep in our clothes
And out in the dark the world is still rolling
Kids in their cars, cigarette smoking
And all that they are just reeks with the sweetest belief

But I let you down
Swollen and small is where you'll find me now
With that silver stripping off
From my tongue you're tearing out
And you'll never hear me talk

All I could want is silver and spinning
Out from your arms and into the pretty
Pit of your heart, so simply and softly we'd flow

But I let you down
Swollen and small is where you'll find me now
With that silver stripping off
From my tongue you're tearing out
And you'll never hear me talk

Glow into you
I will glow into you"

I won't be nailing you down in the nursery
Just like the rest of them did
With those watery, wandering fingers of spit
That were supposed to be glorious and fine
Oh sister, won't you believe in me
I only wanted to be hard on the family
Here with you now in this silly infirmary
Your mother makes frantic and drunk calls
From Germany all of the time
And oh sister, sweet brown and beulahery
And milk from your blisters
On your grandmother's jewelry
There in the parlor all naked in front of me
Watching the lights from the cracks
Making archery animal designs

Rose Wallace Goldaline just moves her mouth over anything
That's fleshy free and flowering like oranges out in the open
But don't you waste your sins again
She don't need you or won't fuck your friends
And you, you're American
Selfimportant boiling over
To prove that she must still exist
She moves herself about her fist
And won't ever never give a shit
About all those words you're wasting
To gain some pretty, bright and bubbly
Wondrous dream
You'd like to kill and cling
And claim her as your own
But don't you worry
All those dainty and dirty emotions
Just go away and fade out on their

Own sister, now that you're leaving
Our fingers will falter
Our lungs will be leaking
All over each other and without even speaking
We'll know that it's over and smile and go greeting
Whatever comes next
And oh, sister
You're getting married with some angry twister
That you'll have to carry home
Drunk every evening from the cemetery
If he makes it back half alive you can
Bury him under your sheets
And oh, sister
Now that you're grieving
I can not imagine there is any meaning
Forgetting you ever could once had
The feeling that made you keep on
And pretend you were breathing of all of this world
And in an age of empty rings
I don't want to feel a thing
I don't even want to know

Don't you ever die on me
Dont you own the way you go"

Makes babies to breathe
With their hearts hanging open all over the sheets
As soft as beets in some brown dresser drawer
And with bees in her breath and the rest of her ringing
They'll sting through her chest with a force hard and beating
Till wonderfully wet she will get
Until she's soaked inside her clothes
And there is no sorry to be sorry for
For a roll around the floor some afternoon so sound and soft
It made her swallow all her sweat
With every bit of breath she coughs
And when the day it came to pour all her babies
All across the bathroom floor
She will be swimming in them all forever more"

My dream girl don't exist

She didn't know that I'd be hanging around
So her parents buried her in the ground
And this day I can still hear the sound of a life in outer space

My dream girl don't exist

And this illness seems to feel so strange
Like a henchman that's about to hang the moon up like a ball and chain
And set its sands ablaze

And the weight is waiting on
Feel the world so real and strong

My dream girl don't exist
Took her photograph from a history book
And I believe she had a voice and name
Three children on the coast of Maine
Her life was in a hurricane of love and real embrace

My dream girl don't exist
At the age of five she slit her wrist
She didn't know that I'd be hanging around
So one day she took a stroll to town
And walked in front of a Greyhound bound for New York central state

And the weight is waiting on

Feel the world so real and strong
She goes and now she knows she'll never be afraid"

Everything you want I'm wanting too
I gave you more than I thought I could ever do
And I will never break you

And if I was the king of all the kids

But all you would hear is the shit inside my burnt emotions
I will bury you in time

Into this hole where you and I will sing our songs unbroken

And steaming yourself in the warm shower spray
And water rolls on off the round captain's belly

As it's reflecting off from you as it shines
You're in the bathroom carving holiday designs into yourself
Hoping no one will find you but they found you
And they took you and you somehow survived

There is no dream
So wake up and if the holidays don't hollow out your eyes
Then press yourself against whatever
You find to be beautiful and trembling with life

And so I go it alone

Bodies multiplying until they finally overtake me

Someone Is Waiting,Neutral Milk Hotel,Beauty,"{'year': 1996, 'month': 3, 'day': 26}","Someone is waiting
To swallow all the halos out of you
As your face blows through my windows
Sending pieces flying all around my room
And I love you and I want to
Shoot all the super heroes from your skies
Watch them bleeding from your ceiling
As their empty anger falls out from their eyes all alone

Growing sleepy as the rain falls
As children draped in flowers form a chain
They sing a song with jelly jars and bird calls
As night falls into dust and it's day again

I'm not afraid of a love parade in my daydream
Old men with kazoos and beating drums
But I awake and I see the streets are ice cream
It's just you and me and oh dear, our life has just begun

Everything is beautiful here
It's spinning circles around my ears
I'm finally breaking free from fear
And it's fading

Oh beautiful smiles, won't you stay awhile
We could close the door and sleep all day
It's a September sky with pretty pictures in my mind
That's lost its feeling of so afraid

Everything is beautiful here
It's spinning circles around my ears
I'm finally breaking free from fear
And it's fading

Grown sleepy now as the rain falls
As children draped in flowers form a chain
They sing a song with jelly jars and bird calls
As night falls into dust and it's day again

Everything is beautiful here
It's spinning circles around my ears
I'm finally breaking free from fear
And it's fading"

A Baby for Pree / Glow into You,Neutral Milk Hotel,Ferris Wheel on Fire,"{'year': 2011, 'month': 12, 'day': 12}","Blistering Pree, all smiling and swollen
Makes babies to breathe
With their hearts hanging open
All over the sheets
As soft as beets in some brown dresser drawer
And with bees in her breath
And the rest of her ringing
They'll sting through her chest
With a force hard and beating
Till wonderfully wet
She will get until she's soaked inside her clothes
And there is no sorry to be sorry for
For a roll around the floor
Some afternoon so sound and soft
It made her swallow all her sweat
With every bit of breath she coughs
And when the day it came to pour
All her babies all across the bathroom floor
She will be swimming in them all forever more

Glow right into you
I will glow right into you
I will glow right into you

And I let you down
Swollen and small
Is where you'll find me now
That silver stripping off
From my tongue you're tearing out
You'll never hear me talk

Glow right into you
I will glow right into you
I will glow right into you

And I will be strong
Strong enough to shout
Above your voice that's blaring on
With your face that's falling out
Into the dust of what you want
I'll never hear you talk

Glow right into you
I will glow right into you
I will glow right into you
Oh and with my little fingers
I could make it all crumble
I could make it all over
Before you would even know
Glow"
Home,Neutral Milk Hotel,Ferris Wheel on Fire,"{'year': 2011, 'month': 12, 'day': 12}","Hold
Well you can hold your hands together all you please
Wont erase those tender tidings you endured
You were just another family member on their knees
Just a social work statistic out the door

They beat against the tender sightings of your soul
With all those pretty little hammers of control
And where they are tonight well you will never know
But I swear that I will find them, now

More
Its more than just a simple question of decay
More than all those fists that beat into your door
Its more than all the shrinks that told you youre okay
Its more than anything that I have waited for

They beat against the tender sightings of your soul
With all those pretty little hammers of control
And if they even can remember I dont know
But I swear that theyll remember, now


Home
Its just another word youll always push away
Just a memory you wear outside your clothes
And it will burn down into cinders and some day
They will burrow down to their parental holes

They beat against the tender sightings of your soul
With all those pretty little hammers of control
And if theyve ever paid a price well I dont know
But I swear that they will pay one, now"

Cindy smiles and overcoats
She says, Please stay a while!""
Like ice cream floats and dreams, and I will fill your heart
With boats and bells and beams and candyappled everythings
Bells and beams and candyappled everythings

Cindy skips my trampoline
With toys and horns and bouncing things
And even the most silent must sing a song of love
Yes even the silent, they must sing a song of love

Ooooh...
Ooooh...

Unhappy girl, she's spinning
These strings in her curls
And it's only the beginning
Of a trip around the world
Cindy, won't you smile?
Cindy, won't you sleep a while?
I feel I'm just a child
Sinking down one hundred million miles

Ooooh...
Ooooh...

Rain...
Rain is a perfectly sculpted garden of wetness"

They dream of waterfalls
Catching slow bright streams of light

Bucket full of fear

And I've still got time to fly away
Shadows in my dreams
They're painting scenes of time with you
I'm hoping all these things
And the strength they bring will see me through

My dream girl dont exist
At the age of five she slit her wrists
She didn't know that I'd be hanging around
So her parents buried her in the ground
My dream girl dont exist
Shes working at a McDonalds in Madison, Wisconsin
She couldve been cool but she let the system get to her
She forgot about art and just made hamburgers
My dream girl dont exist
They're all sittin' around, watching TV
They're all stuffing―
