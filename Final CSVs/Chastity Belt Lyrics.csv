Different Now,Chastity Belt,I Used to Spend So Much Time Alone,"{'year': 2017, 'month': 3, 'day': 8}","Well you can't always be right
All those little things that keep you up at night
You should take some time to figure out your life
But you're stuck indoors and thinking poorly
You'll find in time
All the answers that you seek
Have been sitting there just waiting to be seen
Take away your pride and take away your grief
And you'll finally be right where you need to be
Take all of it, take everything you're owed
'Til you finally feel okay being alone
Yeah it's different now
Yeah it's different now, you're old
And you try and you try and you try and you try"

I wanna be sincere
But nothing's ever really free when you're living in fear

Out of the fog and finally feeling fine
My doubts are all gone and I'm having a pretty good time
Feeling like a real champ, but for how long?
I used to spend so much time alone
Higher than high
I wanna be bad
Compete with myself
See how much I can stand
I'd ask you to stay
But my pride is too strong
I would rather be alone than ask for what I want

We're all talking about nothing
I wanna do something cool
And I wanna get paid
And wake up feeling great every day
Is that too much to ask?
Is that too much to ask?
Well maybe, I'm an idiot

Thoughts drowned in darker thoughts of
Sinking feelings
I'd rather be thinking about something else
Now the walls are caving in
I see and feel everything in waves
And the air is too thick
It's making me sick
I should get out and get over it

Sinking feelings
I'd rather be thinking about something else"

On a buzz, feel the waves in my brain
Saying things I shouldn't say

Immediate urge to get everything all straight
Need to express it, but it's not the time or place
Get strength from what you don't reveal
Communication's pretty hard
I've got some thoughts I cling to
What makes you bitter makes you old
A lot of time to sit and think
And good thoughts don't come naturally
Feeling out of touch with reality
But you've got the answers that I need

Immediate urge to get everything all straight
Need to express it, but it's not the time or place
Get strength from what you don't reveal
Communication's pretty hard
I've got some thoughts I cling to
What makes you bitter makes you old"

What if I split right down
Down the middle of it all?
Will you, will you tell me when its over?
And until then I will keep my eyes closed
You take yours and Ill take mine
You take mine, so Ill take yours
What if you just take it all, both sides
Sink to the bottom and youll find
You are just another shark
Try to talk on the brink of sleep
Ive got nothing
Shutting down cause I might have to think
About nothing
And you dont how strong your teeth are
Until you bite
Or if they'll grow back when you lose them
Until you try"

Flashing headlights and the waves reflect the sun
When you said, I feel like dying""
I don't wanna hear the things you have to say
It's just the adrenaline talking
Don't share your feelings about me
I'm sorry I just don't have the capacity
Slice the water with the sharp knife of your hand
Never seen a stroke so smooth
Same long fingers that can carry any mood
And relieve the pain I carry
You can stay awhile
But you can't sleep in my bed
Tell your girlfriend she's got nothing to fеar
I'm set in my head
My body's a differеnt story"

But instead
All my needs bend
To fit in
I will sit still with my doubt

I don't wanna leave my house
At the time, everything felt new
And one night could really change you

Someone like me can't let go of anything, moments move like chemtrails in my mind
Now I want more, thinking I deserve less, maybe I'll be happier this time

The warmth of everything, I waited and it came
We'll be good, or at least, we should
What morе can we really ask for?

Someonе like me can't let go of anything, moments move like chemtrails in my mind
Now I want more, thinking I deserve less, apathy is difficult to hide

Now I'm weightless like I've been erased, I'm painting us a picture in my head"

I think it's my ego that's been bringing me down

I saw the garden that she tended out back
Isn't life so normal?"" She looked at me and laughed

And it was doomed right from the start

It's kind of tragic, but it's fine
I don't mind
We're just stuck in the wrong timeline
You're a tease
But it's not like you know me well

An underlying sense of grief
That can't be consoled by anything
I don't wanna be a bitch

You would want
I bet you're glad that I'm not fragile

Drawing a line straight through my thoughts
Pull out the knife and clean it off
Surrender to the fear that lives inside me
Stare into to the mirror and meet my shame

Ooh

Searching for meaning, something I never had
Why's everything normal feel so bad?

Out of the blue
Out of the blue
Ooh

Now all your anger will just turn around on you
That thing where misery and rage become confused
You suck the air out of the room

We can't help but sit and stare
Silence breaks, I don't know what to think
Holding feelings in the air

And all that time my head was gone
I'd never felt so numb
But waiting's just my game
And living's worth some pain
And what's the point of anything
If I always feel the same?
I could tell you anything
I could tell you everything

Always
Chasing that same feeling, but it starts fading
Seattle seems so different when it's not raining
Nothing that I do or say today will mean a thing
But I'm not that devastated

No
