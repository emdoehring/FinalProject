Random Rules,Silver Jews,American Water,"{'year': 1998, 'month': 10, 'day': 20}","In , I was hospitalized for approaching perfection
Slowly screwing my way across Europe, they had to make a correction
Broken and smokin' where the infrared deer plunge in the digital snake
I tell you, they make it so you can't shake hands when they make your hands shake

I know you like to line dance
Everything so democratic and cool
But, baby, there's no guidance when random rules

I know that a lot of what I say has been lifted off of men's room walls
Maybe I've crossed the wrong rivers and walked down all the wrong halls
But nothing can change the fact that we used to share a bed
And that's why it scared me so when you turned to me and said:

Yeah, you look like someone
Yeah, you look like someone who up and left me low
Boy, you look like someone I used to know""

I know you'd like to line dance
With everything so democratic and cool
But, baby, there's no guidance when random rules

I asked the painter why the roads are colored black
He said, Steve, it's because people leave
And no highway will bring them back""
So if you don't want me, I promise not to linger
But before I go, I've gotta ask you, dear, about that tan line on your ring finger

No one should have two lives
Now you know my middle names are Wrong and Right
Honey, we've got two lives to give tonight
To give tonight
To give tonight
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh"
Smith & Jones Forever,Silver Jews,American Water,"{'year': 1998, 'month': 10, 'day': 20}","Can you summon honey from a telephone?
They sat there with their hooks in the water
And their mustaches caked with airplane glue
O come let us adore them
California overboard
When the sun sets on the ghetto
All the broken stuff gets cold
Smith and Jones forever!
Smith and Jones forever!
Smith and Jones forever, together forever and ever
Build a stage for Autumn's bitch
They walk the alleys in duct tape shoes
They see the things they need through the windows of a hatchback
The alleys are the footnotes of the avenues
O come let us adore them
California overboard
Holding up their trousers with extension cords
Smith and Jones forever!
Smith and Jones forever!
Smith and Jones forever, together forever and ever
I've got two tickets to a midnight execution
We'll hitchhike our way from Odessa to Houston
And when they turn on the chair
Something's added to the air
When they turn on the chair
Something's added to the air forever
To the air forever!
Smith and Jones forever!
Smith and Jones forever, together forever and ever"
The Wild Kindness,Silver Jews,American Water,"{'year': 1998, 'month': 10, 'day': 20}","On a classic nitrogen afternoon
Some power that hardly looked like power
Said I'm perfect in an empty room
Four dogs in the distance
Each stands for a kindness, yeah
Bluebirds lodged in an evergreen altar
I'm gonna shine out in the wild silence
I'm gonna shine out in the wild silence
I'm gonna shine out in the wild silence
And spurn the sin of giving in
Oil paintings of xrated picnics
Behind the walls of medication, I'm free
Every leaf in a compact mirror
Hits a target that we can't see
Grass grows in the icebox
The year ends in the next room
It is autumn and my camouflage is dying
Instead of time, there will be lateness
Instead of time, there will be lateness
Instead of time, there will be lateness
And let forever be delayed
I dyed my hair in a motel void
Met the coroner at Dreamgate Frontier
He took my hand, and said, I'll help you, boy
If you really want to disappear""
Four dogs in the distance
Each stands for a silence, yeah
Bluebirds lodged in an evergreen altar
I'm gonna shine out in the wild kindness
I'm gonna shine out in the wild kindness
I'm gonna shine out in the wild kindness
And hold the world to its word"
People,Silver Jews,American Water,"{'year': 1998, 'month': 10, 'day': 20}","Moments can be monuments to you
If your life is interesting and true
It's just the same for a man or a girl
The meaning of the world lies outside the world
People love people and they understand
If you want to renovate your background mind
A federal woman needs municipal man
People gotta synchronize to animal time

You can't change the feeling
But you can change the feeling about the feelings in a second or two, uh huh
People always come around
I'm studying the ceiling on a little afternoon
And when I paint my dining room, uh huh
People gonna come around

I love to see a rainbow from a garden hose
Lit up like the blood of a centerfold
I love the city and the city rain
Suburban kids with biblical names
People ask people to watch their scotch
People send people up to the moon
When they return, well, there isn't much
People be careful not to crest too soon

The drums march along at the clip of an IV. drip
Like sparks from a muffler dragged down the strip, uh huh
I really hope you'll come around
It's sunny and 
It feels so good to be alive
Come on, baby, don't stay inside
Everybody's coming out tonight"
Trains Across the Sea,Silver Jews,Starlite Walker,"{'year': 1994, 'month': 10, 'day': 24}","On the line
And I can't stand to see you
I can't stand to see you
When you're crying at home
Scotch and penicillin
Please try Carlton
A cold black maple hangar
And husbands on the run
I just got back from a dream attack
That took me by surprise
And in there, I met a lady
Her name was Shady Sides
And she said
It's been evening all day long
It's been evening all day long
And how can something so old
Be so wrong?""
Sin and gravity
Drag me down to sleep
To dream of trains across the sea
Trains across the sea
Half hours on earth
What are they worth?
I don't know
In  years
I've drunk fifty thousand beers
And they just wash against me
Like the sea into a pier..."
Pretty Eyes,Silver Jews,The Natural Bridge,"{'year': 1996, 'month': 10, 'day': 1}","But everybody's wants can't make it past a window sill
I can see you in your room at night
Pictures on your walls
Little forest scenes and high school Halloweens
But they don't come to you
They don't come to you at all
All houses dream in blueprints
Our houses dream so hard
Outside, you can see my shoeprints
I've been dreaming in your yard
One of these days, these days will end
The kitchen window, the light will bend
You'll be carving a pumpkin with a knife
When someone at the table says:
That's not what I call a life!""
The elephants are so ashamed of their size
Hosing them down, I tell 'em, You got pretty eyes""
Out in the backyard, I used to make like I was a cowboy
I'd set my dog before a hoop and say, Now boy, now boy!""
When the governor's heart fails
The state bird falls from its branch
Icicles on hell's higher hills
Meanwhile, back home at the ranch
I still get up early in the morning
And I never knew a better place
I believe that stars are the headlights of angels
Driving from heaven to save us, to save us
Look in the sky
They're driving from heaven into our eyes
And final words are so hard to devise
I promise that I'll always remember your pretty eyes
Your pretty eyes"
Dallas,Silver Jews,The Natural Bridge,"{'year': 1996, 'month': 10, 'day': 1}","The CPR was so erotic
A blizzard blew in through the door
And little glowing cum buckets in her ankles
O Dallas, you shine with an evil light
O Dallas, you shine with an evil light
How'd you turn a billion steers
Into buildings made of mirrors?
And why am I drawn to you tonight?
Once you taste the geometry of a church in a culdesac
You're gonna wanna sit with the bad kids in the back
Cruising down Commerce
Killing time in the blazing sun
Is it true your analyst was a placekicker for the Falcons?
We saw BB. King on General Hospital
In the Oak Cliff dram house where we stayed
And when Clancy whipped her with his belt buckle
He cleaned her cuts and then we prayed
O Dallas, you shine with an evil light
Don't you know that God stays up all night?
How'd you turn a billion steers
Into buildings made of mirrors?
And why am I drawn to you tonight?
Watching the makeup girls make out with the mannequins
Hey boys, supper's on me, our record just went aluminum""
Poor as a mouse every morning
Rich as a cat every night
Some kind of strange magic happens
When the city turns on her lights"
Send in the Clouds,Silver Jews,American Water,"{'year': 1998, 'month': 10, 'day': 20}","Shut all the blinds, and turn out the lights
I feel insane when you get in my bed

Whether I should be allowed in the game
Why can't monsters get along with other monsters?
Soi disantra
Soi disantra
Soi disantra
I know a puppy who walked from Kentucky
Made it to East Virginia by dawn
He had seventeen ideas in his head
Windex tears flow down the robot's face

My momma named me after a king
I'm gonna bury my name in you

We Are Real,Silver Jews,American Water,"{'year': 1998, 'month': 10, 'day': 20}","And I will see you soon, my friend
If these old directions still direct, oh yeah
If these old directions still direct
Is the problem that we can't see, or is it that the problem is beautiful to me?
Birds of Virginia are flying within you
Like background singers, they all come in threes
Like background singers, they all come in threes
Won't soul music change now that our souls have turned strange?
Once a day, twice a day
When on and off collide
We'll set our souls aside and walk away
We've been raised on replicas
Of fake and winding roads
And day after day, up on this beautiful stage
We've been playing tambourine for minimum wage
But we are real, real
I know we are real
Repair is the dream of the broken thing
Like a message broadcast on an overpass
All my favorite singers couldn't sing
All my favorite singers couldn't sing
My ski vest has buttons like convenience store mirrors
And they help me see
That everything in this room right now is a part of me
Oh yeah, is a part of me
Won't soul music change now that our souls have turned strange?
Once a day, twice a day
When on and off collide
We'll set our souls aside and walk away
Realizing is how it feels
Inside when it happens to you
So I took a shot of sugar like snow dumped into the blood
And children wander off into the ultraeconomic
But we're real
We are real
I know we are real
I know we are real
I know we are real, real, real, real, real"
Tennessee,Silver Jews,Bright Flight,"{'year': 2001, 'month': 11, 'day': 5}","I saw the river playing in the valley
Rushing 'round a bend and skipping stones
I saw the meadow wobble in the moonlight
I've come to get my girl and take her home

Her doorbell plays a bar of Stephen Foster
Her sister never left and look what it cost her
We're gonna live in Nashville and I'll make a career
Out of writing sad songs and gettin' paid by the tear

Marry me and leave Kentucky
Come to Tennessee
'Cause you're the only ten I see
You're the only ten I see

I've looked through offices and honkytonks
For men man enough to be
Mister, Misses Tennessee
Mister, Misses Tennessee

Punk rock died when the first kid said
Punk's not dead, punk's not dead""
You know Louisville is death, we've got to up and move
Because the dead do not improve

Goodbye users and suckers and steady bad luckers
We're off to the land of club soda unbridled
We're off to the land of hot middleaged women
Off to the land whose blood runneth orange

Marry me and leave Kentucky
And come to Tennessee
'Cause you're the only ten I see
You're the only ten I see

I've looked through offices and honkytonks
For men man enough to be

How to Rent a Room,Silver Jews,The Natural Bridge,"{'year': 1996, 'month': 10, 'day': 1}","I only want to die in your eyes
I'm still here below the chandelier
Where they always used to read us our rights
I want to wander through the night
As a figure in the distance even to my own eye
Have you ever rented a room?
Have you even ever rented a room?
Anchor lets you see the river move
But now that your evil dreams came true
There on your face
A row of teeth he'll come to replace
I know you laughed when I left
But you really only hurt yourself
When you see your curtains move in the wind
You can bet I'm betting against you again
'Cause I'm a man who has a wife who has a mother
Who married one but she loved another
You're a tower without the bells
You're a negative wishing well
I should've checked the stable door
For the name of the sire and dam
You were always at the dog track
With your brother and all his friends
Chalk lines around my body
Like the shoreline of a lake
Your laughter made me nervous
It made your body shake too hard
Now, there's a lot of things that I'm gonna miss
Like thunder down country and the way water drips
When you're running for the door in the rain
Read the metro section
Read the metro section
Read the metro section
See my name
No, I didn't really want to die
I only want to die in your eyes
Grant me one last wish
Life should mean a lot less than this
Grant me one last wish
Life should mean a lot less than this"
Blue Arrangements,Silver Jews,American Water,"{'year': 1998, 'month': 10, 'day': 20}","In the Greenwood southside society pool
I love your amethyst eyes and your Protestant thighs
You're a shimmering socialite jewel
From the Carbon Dioxide Riding Academy
To the children's crusade marching through the downtown
Well, I think I'd die, see, if you just said hi to me
When something breaks, it makes a beautiful sound
Sometimes I feel like I'm watching the world
And the world isn't watching me back
But when I see you, I'm in it too
The waves come in and the waves go back
And the kids in the corner all covered in dirt
Caught trespassing under the moon
My father came in from wherever he'd been
And kicked my shit all over the room
All over the room
All over the room
The room is dark and heavy with what I want to say
I see murals in the radio static and on your blue blue jeans
What would you say if I asked you to run away?
It's been done so many times, I hardly know what it means
I took these blue arrangements and threw them in the sea
When older waves from older caves brought them back to me
I took these blue arrangements and stored them on a shelf
With coins on the mantle and time in a candle, in the end a boy raises himself"
The Frontier Index,Silver Jews,The Natural Bridge,"{'year': 1996, 'month': 10, 'day': 1}","I always looked up to you
And after millions of years of crime
The sun still shines and shines
Look, a horse, of course
Gallops through the desert light
I make such good time through subspace

Robot walks into a bar
Orders a drink, lays down a bill
Bartender says, Hey, we don't serve robots""
And the robot says, Oh, but someday you will""
Prison's a good time for some
Many people get caught with a gun
This trucker says it's good to be free
Says he knows lots of folks who agree
Bumper stickers talk to him
Say, Let the stars get in your eyes""
Time, cum, sand, and surf
These are the building, building blocks of life
Boy wants a car from his dad
Dad says, First, you got to cut that hair""
Boy says, Hey, Dad, Jesus had long hair""
And Dad says, That's right, son, Jesus walked everywhere""
When I was younger, I was a cobra
In every case, I wanted to be cool
Now that I'm older and subspace is colder
Just wanna say something true"
Candy Jail,Silver Jews,"Lookout Mountain, Lookout Sea","{'year': 2008, 'month': 6, 'day': 17}","So does pleasure in a candy jail
True love doesn't come around anymore than fate allows
On a Monday in Fort Lauderdale
I came all this way to see your grave
To see your life as writ in paraphrase
I have tried thee,"" it is written, in the furnace of affliction""
This is what you couldn't face
Life in a candy jail
With peppermint bars
Peanutbrittle bunk beds
And marshmallow walls
Where the guards are gracious
And the grounds are grand
And the warden keeps the data on your favorite brands
Jelly beans and cookie dough
Country restroom on the radio
I got a number on my name
It's hard to rise above the shame
I'm a branded man made in the mold
These terms engulf the waking mind
Like cherry, grape and lemonlime
Like candy corn and licorice
Like bubblegum and Swedish fish
It happens to me all the time
Living in a candy jail
With peppermint bars
Peanutbrittle bunk beds
And marshmallow walls
Where the guards are gracious
And the grounds are grand
And the warden really listens
And he understands"
Buckingham Rabbit,Silver Jews,American Water,"{'year': 1998, 'month': 10, 'day': 20}","I'd been lonely since she found Christ
Now is the time to depend on the law
The nights of my professional life
It's the nights of my professional life
I was living in a very young city
Grand piano, great lakes, goodbye
If you ask me my name, it's highlowjack in the game
I can track a single bee to the hive
Every single game was a blowout
And the NASCAR blurred into porn
Scenic this, scenic that, don't fall for the traps
Of a man who was never born
A man who was never born
So the rent became whiskey
And then my life became risky
And so the rent became whiskey, whiskey
Shattered dogs on the rocks
At the back of the bar, there's a couch
Where the lonely people go and lie
They talk to the honky tonk psychiatrist
Into the wee hours of the night
Into the wee hours of the night
The factory's on muscle relaxers
The pine perfume of hilltown floors
The lover, the thinker, the talker, the singer
Won't be lucid for her anymore
They won't be lucid for her anymore
And so the rent became whiskey
And then my life became risky
And so the rent became whiskey, whiskey
Shattered dogs on the rocks, shattered dogs on the rocks
When you know how I feel, I feel better
When you're fifteen, you wanna look poor
You do unto others and run like a mother
I don't wanna look poor anymore
No, I don't wanna look poor anymore
Jesus in a runaway shelter
Said, The deaf have pictures of you""

Mother and child with magazine
Into a story, into a dream
Why is there something instead of nothing?
And how is the asking built into the hunting?
Do you believe in MGM endings?
Everybody's coming back to Christmas for Texas
Folks who've watched their mother kill an animal know that their home is surrounded by places to go
And the west has made a deal with the sun
My life at home every day
Drinking coke in a kitchen with a dog who doesn't know his name
Oh, right, it could have been anyone
Grass rabbits, grass rabbits, grass rabbits, grass rabbits, grass
Nobody cares about a dead hooker
Looking like one, standing for many
Life finds a limit at the edge of our bodies
A stranger begins wherever I see 'em
Let's live where the indoors and the outdoors meet
All the kids in the commonwealth are free
Every morning you forgive me, every evening you relive me and the thing itself is what you give me
And the morning has cut a deal with the east

Air crickets, air crickets, air crickets, air crickets, air"
Black and Brown Blues,Silver Jews,The Natural Bridge,"{'year': 1996, 'month': 10, 'day': 1}","I got two pairs of shoes
Darling, you look so beautiful
When your hair's all hung in jewels
And sometimes I find it really hard to choose
Between a pair of black and a pair of brown shoes
When I'm high on bat wings
Up by the silvery moon
I think of a certain sad king
Trapped in his golden room
And I dream of a cold river on the way
To come and sweep that king into this black and brown bay
Well, the water looks like jewelry
When it's coming out the spout
Nothing could make me feel better
Than a wet kiss on the mouth
Fake ID.'s and honey bees
The jagged skyline of car keys
I never knew a bird could fly so low
Rub out the catlight
Rub out the village
Red and white exit light
That's exodus damage
Why don't people think of who they use?
Why don't you try and come and get me
Black and brown blues
It's raining triple sec in Tchula
And the radio plays Crazy Train""
There's a quadroon ball in the beehive
Hanging out in the rain
And when there's trouble, I don't like running
But I'm afraid I got more in common
With who I was than who I am becoming
When I go downtown
I always wear a corduroy suit
Because it's made of a hundred gutters
That the rain can run right through
But a lonely man can't make a move
If he can't even bring himself to choose
Between a pair of black and a pair of brown shoes"

Pet Politics,Silver Jews,The Natural Bridge,"{'year': 1996, 'month': 10, 'day': 1}","While the rain turns the ditches to mirrors

And in the cold places where Spanish is spoken
Most wars end in the fall
You never know
When your pet will go

Pet politics
Pet politics
Pet politics
Still wearin' last night's mascara
Now that her pet was gone for sure
She was shiverin' so hard
It looked like there were two of her
I could see through the sleeve on her blouse
The plans of her architect lover
A tattoo of a boardedup house
And ink door that belonged to another
When the rain hits you
It hits you slow
Stitch after stitch
Stitch after stitch
Stitch after stitch
Stitch after stitch
Adam was not the first man
Though the Bible tells us so
There was one created before him
Whose name we do not know
He also lived in the garden
But he had no mouth or eyes
One day, Adam came to kill him
And he died beneath these skies

I go where I'm led

We could belong to each other
If you're not seeing anyone

But I been around some and I've seen
Enough to know we could both spend happy lives
Inside the days of you and me

The things that you do will always make your mama cry

They have time to talk because their race is run
So get in some licks and hold your head up
And soon you'll be drinking from that crystal cup

The moon was worn just slightly on the right
And they slow danced so the needle wouldn't skip
Until the room was filled with light
And I remember you
And I remember me
The sunshine walking inside you
And the man you could see in me
So I remember me
And I remember you
So many beautiful days in a row now
And the nights were perfect, too
Hand in hand down a waterslide in Chattanooga
They did not hide from love, you see
A winter's plane flight to Aruba
Where he threw a boombox into the sea
One day, they were cutting flowers for something to do
On the bank of the road 'neath the cotton woods
And he turned to her to ask if she'd marry him
When a runaway truck hit him where he stood
So I remember you
And I remember you
And I remember you
And I remember me
And I remember me
A blackhawk nailed to the sky
And the tape hiss from the trees
Everybody said she needed to move on
That he was all but lost, so deep was his coma
When he finally came to, the girl he loved was long gone
She'd married a banker and gone to Oklahoma
He bought a little land with the money from the settlement
And even bought the truck that had hit him that day
He touched the part where the metal was bent
And if you were there, you wouldn't hear him say
I remember her
And I remember him
I remember them
I remember then
I'm just remembering

We have no goodwill, no goodwill to give
To those who try to take away the things we need to live
Friend, this is from your friend, off of Natchez Trace
The last dream left worth believing starts with animal shapes
Animal shapes, animal shapes
Nothing better get in the way of whatever it takes
Later on, somewhere else, I said some things I didn't mean
Yes, I know everybody's on a first name basis with the king
From a corner window, I watch the falling snowflakes
God must be carving the clouds into animal shapes
Animal shapes, animal shapes
God must be carving the clouds into animal shapes"
Living Waters,Silver Jews,Starlite Walker,"{'year': 1994, 'month': 10, 'day': 24}","And I'm never sure which one I am
So come in out of the storm
What you need is an imitation of home, alright
You're at home, you're all alone
And nobody's calling on the telephone
People are good and people are bad
People they butch, people they brag
People they test, people they breast
People name sex as their favorite thing to do
So if you run, then run to me
And if you can swim, then swim to me
Just come in out of the storm
What you need is an imitation of home
You're at home, you're all alone
And nobody's calling on the telephone"
"The Poor, the Fair and the Good",Silver Jews,Tanglewood Numbers,"{'year': 2005, 'month': 10, 'day': 18}","And stays in the woods for days
We were built to consider the unmanifested
And make of love an immaculate place
I hear a smile and a tear in you voice
Don't lay the groundwork for a case of remorse
When you feel that first ice cold twist in the wind
I'll come back the way that I came
Shot of dixie hemlock will take care of the pain
Now a man keeps his money folded square in his pocket
And doesn't take everything that he could
He'll rise like a lion and line himself up
With the poor, the fair, and the good
When you feel that first ice cold twist in the wind
Will you hang a lamp at the end of the lane?
Blackeyed Susans from the Maryland shore
We'll trim back the thorns around the hospital door
More will be seen than will be understood
Go with the poor, the fair, and the good
The poor, the fair, and the good"

Pan American Blues,Silver Jews,Starlite Walker,"{'year': 1994, 'month': 10, 'day': 24}","The federales back from Tucson, each one got an arm gone
Limehouse Pratt got dim inside
Can't see the painted ladies runaround at night
A woodpaneled room
My cigarette fumes waltz and dissolve just for you
There's gonna be a truce
There's gonna be a truce
There's gonna be a truce
But first you got to set your horses loose
A jaguar simmering in a cage
Give him a chance
Can you tell the answer from the ants?
History's got its walking papers
Can't get enough of the makeup
That makes it look so tough
Well, it seems just like a freezeout
Seems just like a freezeout
Seems just like a freezeout
An undisclosed, deeply wooded
Lose your way route"
Tide to the Oceans,Silver Jews,Starlite Walker,"{'year': 1994, 'month': 10, 'day': 24}","A million chuckers never felt wrong
Looking at you, I'm astaring
Look at how you make me feel good now
Broken like you know the child diction
Over at the naked show
Sarah couldn't make you feel down now
Down, down, down, down, down, down, down, down, down
Wait for the last man
Last man never had a chance
So he went out behind the shed
And bought himself a little cigarettes
On the ground digging for a treasure map
Find your answer
When you ask, please ask me
Ask me to stay
And I said ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh"

Want this minute to end?
And then it ends"
The Country Diary of a Subway Conductor,Silver Jews,Starlite Walker,"{'year': 1994, 'month': 10, 'day': 24}","What if it cost  cents to wake up in the morning?
A dollar, ten dollars?
He'd pay it all the way to the poor house
It's not made if it's in Roanoke
Okay, here it comes, night
He's pulling up in front of our house like a bus
Came at me with shears
Her sweater had faces all over it, famous faces knitted all over it
The porch swing ticked off Central Daylight time
How many hours do you think it'll take me to smoke this cigarette?"" she said with a smile
The smell of fried foods came drifting out one of the castle windows
Let's go around back,"" I said
My brother buried some stuff back there""
We ducked down and walked through the black bushes
My shoe made a sucking sound in the turf
He can afford anything,"" I said
He's got dogs that blow on trumpets""
Priests!"" she cussed
Thunder cracks over Ben Franklin's shop
Who wrapped my dreams in a blanket and led them outside to the black book in the yard?
This river leads right up to the party
How do you like my little boat?
This is the way the pioneers took to other settlements
We'll be there in ten minutes
You can see the lanterns from here
When we get there, we'll go upstairs and make free longdistance phonecalls
Hey, what Indian tribe occupied southern California?
They were a lucky bunch of fellers!""
Sting Bible, More Sea Bible, Knur & Spell
In moments downhill, in moments downhill
Towards sleep in the Stillwater shop
Imagining places I was almost sure I'd never been
And had taken to assuming were the memories of my grandfather somehow deposited in my mind
They were there and gone
Just before I could get my bearings
Catch any names or find out where the hotel was
She piled up glass shavings that could not
Ever be reassembled into the gone order of buildings and the shade pouring off of 'em
Water!"""
