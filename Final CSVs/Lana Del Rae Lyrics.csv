Young and Beautiful,Lana Del Rae,The Great Gatsby: Music from Baz Luhrmann’s Film (Deluxe Edition),"{'year': 2013, 'month': 4, 'day': 23}","I've seen the world, done it all
Had my cake now
Diamonds, brilliant, and Bel Air now
Hot summer nights, midJuly
When you and I were forever wild
The crazy days, city lights
The way you'd play with me like a child

Will you still love me when I'm no longer young and beautiful?
Will you still love me when I got nothing but my aching soul?
I know you will, I know you will, I know that you will
Will you still love me when I'm no longer beautiful?

I've seen the world, lit it up as my stage now
Channeling angels in the new age now
Hot summer days, rock and roll
The way you'd play for me at your show
And all the ways I got to know
Your pretty face and electric soul

Will you still love me when I'm no longer young and beautiful?
Will you still love me when I got nothing but my aching soul?
I know you will, I know you will, I know that you will
Will you still love me when I'm no longer beautiful?

Dear Lord, when I get to Heaven
Please, let me bring my man
When he comes, tell me that You'll let him in
Father, tell me if You can
All that grace, all that body
All that face makes me wanna party
He's my sun, he makes me shine like diamonds

Will you still love me when I'm no longer young and beautiful?
Will you still love me when I got nothin' but my aching soul?
I know you will, I know you will, I know that you will
Will you still love me when I'm no longer beautiful?

Will you still love me when I'm no longer beautiful?
Will you still love me when I'm not young and beautiful?"

Summertime sadness
I just wanted you to know
That, baby, you the best

I got my red dress on tonight
Dancin' in the dark, in the pale moonlight
Done my hair up real big, beauty queen style
High heels off, I'm feelin' alive

Oh my God, I feel it in the air
Telephone wires above are sizzlin' like a snare
Honey, I'm on fire, I feel it everywhere

Got my bad baby by my heavenly side
I know, if I go, I'll die happy tonight

But something keeps me really quiet, I'm alive, I'm a lush
Your love, your love, my love

I can see my baby swinging
His Parliament's on fire and his hands are up
On the balcony and I'm singing
Ooh, baby, ooh, baby, I'm in love

Down on the West coast, they love their movies
Their golden gods and rock 'n' roll groupies
And you've got the music

You push it hard, I pull away, I'm feeling hotter than fire
I guess that no one ever really made me feel that much higher

I haven't done a cartwheel since I was nine
I haven't seen my mother in a long, long time
I mean, look at me
Look at the length of my hair and my face, the shape of my body
Do you really think I give a damn
What I do after years of just hearing them talking?

I say I live in Rosemead, really, I'm at the Ramada
It doesn't really matter, doesn't really, really matter

Call him up, Come into my bedroom""
Ended up, we fuck on the hotel floor
It's not about havin' someone to love me anymorе
This is the experiеnce of bein' an American whore

Called up one drunk, called up another
Forensic Files wasn't on
Watching Teenage Diary of a Girl
Wondering what went wrong
I'm a princess, I'm divisive
Ask me why, why, why I'm like this
Maybe I'm just kinda like this
I don't know, maybe I'm just like this

I say I live in Rosemead, really, I'm at the Ramada
It doesn't really matter, doesn't really, really matter

Call him up, he comes over again
Yeah, I know I'm over my head, but, oh
It's not about havin' someone to love me anymore
No, this is the experience of bein' an American whore

I mean, look at my hair
Look at the length of it and the shape of my body
If I told you that I was raped
Do you really think that anybody would think
I didn't ask for it? I didn't ask for it
I won't testify, I already fucked up my story
On top of this Mm), so many other things you can't believe
Did you know a singer can still be
Looking like a sidepiece at thirtythree?
Got a cop who turned on the backbeat
Puts the shower on while he calls me
Slips out the back door to talk to me
I'm invisible, look how you hold me
I'm invisible, I'm invisible
I'm a ghost now, look how you hold me now
It's not about havin' someone to love me anymore Oh, okay)

Except hope is a dangerous thing for a woman like me to have
Hope is a dangerous thing for a woman with my past

There's a new revolution, a loud evolution that I saw
Born of confusion and quiet collusion of which mostly I've known

Thinking, I wish I could extrapolate some small intention
Or maybe just get your attention for a minute or two""

Will I die? Or will I get to that tenyear mark?
Where I beat the extinction of telomeres?
And if I do, will you be there with me, Father, Sister, Brother?

Charlie, stop smoking
Caroline, will you be with me?
Will the baby be alright?
Will I have one of mine?
Can I handle it even if I do?
It's said that my mind
Is not fit, or so they said, to carry a child
I guess I'll be fine

It wasn't my idea, the cocktail of things that twists neurons inside
But without them, I'd die
They say there's irony in the music, it's a tragedy, I
See nothing Greek in it
Give me a mausoleum in Rhode Island with Dad, Grandma, Grandpa, and Dave
Who hung himself real high
In the National Park sky, it's a shame and I'm crying right now
To get to you, save you, if I take my life
Find your astral body, put it into my arms
Give you two seconds to cry
Take you home, I, I'll give you a blanket
Your spirit can sit and watch TV by my side
'Cause, baby, I
Ran through a time when I felt you were doing it

I couldn't handle it, I was in Monaco
I couldn't hear what they said on the telephone
I had to sing for the prince in two hours
Sat in the shower
Gave myself two seconds to cry
It's a shame that we die

When I was fifteen, naked, nextdoor neighbors did a driveby
Pulled me up by my waist, long hair to the beach side
I wanted to go out like you, swim with the fishes
That he caught on Rhode Island beaches
But, sometimes, it's just not your time
Caroline, what kind of mother was she to say I'd end up in institutions?
All I wanted to do was kiss Aaron Greene and sit by
The lake, twisting lime into the drinks that they made
Have a babe at sixteen in the town I was born in, and die

Aaron ended up dead and not me
What the fuck's wrong in your head to send me away, never to come back?
Exotic places and people don't take the place of being your child
I give myself two seconds to cry
Let it crash over me
Like the waves in the sea
Call me Aphrodite, as they bow down to me

Sunbather, moon chaser, queen of empathy
I give myself two seconds to breathe
And go back to being a serene queen
I just needed two seconds to be me"

But I can't fix him, can't make him better
And I can't do nothing about his strange weather

But you are unfixable
I can't break through your world
'Cause you live in shades of cool
Your heart is unbreakable

My baby lives in shades of cool
Cold heart and hands and aptitude
He lives for love, for women, too
I'm one of many, Bonnie's blue
And when he calls, he calls for me and not for you
He prays for love, he prays for peace, and maybe someone new

But I can't help him, can't make him better
And I can't do nothing about his strange weather

'Cause you are unfixable
I can't break through your world
'Cause you live in shades of cool
Your heart is unbreakable

Your hot, hot weather in the summer
High, high, neglectful lover
Hot, hot weather in the summer
High, neglectful lover
You're crumbling, sadly
You're sadly, crumbling

You are unfixable
I can't break through your world
'Cause you live in shades of cool

13 Beaches,Lana Del Rae,Lust for Life,"{'year': 2017, 'month': 7, 'day': 21}","I don't belong in the world, that's what it is
Something separates me from other people
Everywhere I turn, there's something blocking my escape

It took thirteen beaches to find one empty
But finally, it's mine
With drippin' peaches, I'm cameraready
Almost all the time

But I still get lonely and, baby, only then
Do I let myself recline
Can I let go, and let your memory dance
In the ballroom of my mind?
Across the county line

It hurts to love you, but I still love you
It's just the way I feel
And I'd be lyin' if I kept hidin'
The fact that I can't deal
And that I've been dyin' for somethin' real
That I've been dyin' for somethin' real

It took thirteen beaches to find one empty
But finally, I'm fine
Past Ventura and lenses plenty
In the white sunshine

But you still can find me, if you ask nicely
Underneath the pines
With the daisies, feelin' hazy
In the ballroom of my mind
Across the county line

It hurts to love you, but I still love you
It's just the way I feel
And I'd be lyin' if I kept hidin'
The fact that I can't deal
And that I've been dyin' for somethin' real
That I've been dyin' for somethin' real

It hurts to love you, but I still love you
It's just the way I feel
And I'd be lyin' if I kept hidin'
The fact that I can't deal
The fact that I can't deal"

How to disappear,Lana Del Rae,Norman Fucking Rockwell!,"{'year': 2019, 'month': 8, 'day': 30}","John met me down on the boulevard
Cry on his shoulder 'cause life is hard
The waves came in over my head
What you been up to, my baby?
Haven't seen you 'round here lately
All of the guys tell me lies, but you don't
You just crack another beer
And pretend that you're still here

This is how to disappear
This is how to disappear

Joe met me down at the training yard
Cuts on his face 'cause he fought too hard
I know he's in over his head
But I love that man like nobody can
He moves mountains and pounds them to ground again
I watched the guys getting high as they fight
For the things that they hold dear
To forget the things they fear

This is how to disappear
This is how to disappear


Now it's been years since I left New York
I've got a kid and two cats in the yard
The California sun and the movie stars
I watch the skies getting light as I write
As I think about those years
As I whisper in your ear

I'm always going to be right here
No one's going anywhere"

And go about the world like I'm having fun

Drop it like it's hot in the pale moonlight

Feeling alright
Mary swaying softly to her heart's delight

Sing that body electric
I'm on fire

The Other Woman,Lana Del Rae,Ultraviolence,"{'year': 2014, 'month': 6, 'day': 13}","The other woman has time to manicure her nails
The other woman is perfect where her rival fails
And she's never seen with pin curls in her hair anywhere
The other woman enchants her clothes with French perfume
The other woman keeps fresh cut flowers in each room
And there are never toys that's scattered everywhere

And when her old man comes to call
He finds her waitin' like a lonesome queen
'Cause to be by her side
It's such a change from old routine
But

The other woman will always cry herself to sleep
The other woman will never have his love to keep
And as the years go by, the other woman will spend her life alone

Alone
Baby, dodo
Ah, ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah
Ooh
Alone"

LA, I'm from nowhere, who am I to love you?
LA, I've got nothing, who am I to love you when I'm feeling this way and I've got nothing to offer?
LA, not quite the city that never sleeps
Not quite the city that wakes, but the city that dreams, for sure
If by dreams, you mean in nightmares
LA, I'm a dreamer, but I'm from nowhere, who am I to dream?
LA, I'm upset, I have complaints, listen to me
They say I came from money and I didn't
And I didn't even have love, and it's unfair
LA, I sold my life rights for a big check and I'm upset
And now I can't sleep at night and I don't know why
Plus, I love Zach, so why did I do that when I know it won't last?
LA, I picked San Francisco because the man who doesn't love me lives there
LA, I'm pathetic, but so are you, can I come home now?
Daughter to no one, table for one
Party of thousands of people I don't know at Delilah where my exhusband works
I'm sick of this, but can I come home now?
Mother to no one, private jet for one
Back home to the Tudor house that borned a thousand murder plots
Hancock Park, it's treated me very badly, I'm resentful
The witch on the corner, the neighbor nobody wanted
The reason for Garcetti's extra security
 LA, I know I'm bad, but I have nowhere else to go, can I come home now?
I never had a mother, will you let me make the sun my own for now, and the ocean my son?
I'm quite good at tending to things despite my upbringing, can I raise your mountains?
I promise to keep them greener, make them my daughters
Teach them about fire, warn them about water
I'm lonely, LA, can I come home now?
I left my city for San Francisco
And I'm writing from the Golden Gate Bridge
But it's not going as I planned
I took a free ride off a billionaire and brought my typewriter
And promised myself that I would stay, but
It's just not going the way that I thought
It's not that I feel different, and I don't mind that it's not hot
It's just that I belong to no one, which means there's only one place for me
The city not quite awake, the city not quite asleep
The city that's still deciding how good it can be
And also
I can't sleep without you
No one's ever really held me like you
Not quite tightly, but certainly, I feel your body next to me
Smoking next to me
Vaping lightly next to me
And I love that you love the neon lights like me
Orange in the distance
We both love that
And I love that we have that in common
Also, neither one of us can go back to New York
For you are unmoving
As for me, it won't be my city again until I'm dead
Fuck the New York Post
LA, who am I to need you when I've needed so much, asked for so much?
And what I've been given, I'm not sure yet
I may never know that either until I'm dead
For now, though, what I do know
Is although I don't deserve you
Not you at your best and your splendor
With towering eucalyptus trees that sway in my dominion
Not you at your worst
Totally on fire, unlivable, unbreathable, I need you
You see, I have no mother
And you do
A continental shelf
A larger piece of land from where you came
And I?
I'm an orphan
A little seashell that rests upon your native shores
One of many, for sure
But because of that, I surely must love you closely to the most of anyone
For that reason, let me love you
Don't mind my desperation
Let me hold you, not just for vacation
But for real and for forever
Make it real life
Let me be a real wife to you
Girlfriend, lover, mother, friend
I adore you
Don't be put off by my quickwordedness
I'm generally quite quiet
Quite a meditator, actually
I'll do very well down by Paramhansa Yogananda's realization center, I'm sure
I promise you'll barely even notice me
Unless you want to notice me
Unless you prefer a rambunctious child
In which case, I can turn it on too
I'm quite good on the stage as you may know
You might have heard of me
So either way, I'll fit in just fine
So just love me by doing nothing
And perhaps, by not shaking the county line
I'm yours if you'll have me
But regardless, you're mine"

For all the things they paid you for, my love

If you lie down with dogs, then you'll get fleas
Be careful of the ones you choose to leave

There's only  hours
And that's not enough
To lie like you lie
Or love like you love

Hmm, hmm
Hmm, hmm

Give me your heat
Give me your diamonds
You hit that street
And my crooked words
You count to three
While they're all dying
You're hard to reach
You're cold to touch

Everyone around here seems to be going down, down, down
If you stick with me, I can take you higher and higher
It feels like all of our friends are lost, nobody's found, found, found

I got so scared, I thought no one could save me
You came along, scooped me up like a baby

Every now and then, the stars align
Boy and girl meet by the great design
Could it be that you and me are the lucky ones?
Everybody told me love was blind
Then I saw your face and you blew my mind
Finally, you and me are the lucky ones this time

Boy, get into my car, got a bad desire
You know that we'll never leave if we don't get out now, now, now
You're a careless con and you're a crazy liar, but baby
Nobody can compare to the way you get down, down, down

I tried so hard to act nice like a lady
You taught me that it was good to be crazy

Every now and then, the stars align
Boy and girl meet by the great design
Could it be that you and me are the lucky ones?
Everybody told me love was blind
Then I saw your face and you blew my mind
Finally, you and me are the lucky ones this time

Feels like, feels like, you know it feels like
Falling in love for the first time
Feels like, you know it feels like
Falling in love

Bluer than velvet was the night
Softer than satin was the light

Warmer than May, her tender sighs

Feeling the rapture grow
Like a flame burning brightly
But when she left, gone was the glow of

Blue velvet
But in my heart there'll always be
Precious and warm a memory
Through the years

And I still can see blue velvet through my tears"

Are both perhaps present in time future
And time future contained in time past
If all time is eternally present
All time is unredeemable
What might have been is an abstraction
Remaining a perpetual possibility
Only in a world of speculation
What might have been and what has been
Point to one end, which is always present
Footfalls echo in the memory
Down the passage which we did not take
Towards the door we never opened
Into the rosegarden"

And discorrupt them, and charge them full with the charge of the Soul

Womanhood, and all that is woman - and the man that comes from woman
The womb, the tits, nipples, breastmilk, tears, laughter, weeping, lovelooks, loveperturbations and rising
The voice, articulation
Language
Whispering, shouting aloud
Food, drink, pulse, digestion, sweat, sleep
Walking, swimming, poise on the hips
Leaping, reclining, embracing, armcurving and tightening
The continual changes of the flex of the mouth
And around the eyes
The skin, the sunburnt shade, freckles, hair
The curious sympathy one feels, when feeling with the hand the naked meat of the body
The circling rivers, the breath, and breathing it in and out
The beauty of the waist, and thence of the hips, and thence downward toward the knees
The thin red jellies within you or within me - the bones and the marrow in the bones
The exquisite realization of health;
Oh I say, these are not the parts and poems of the Body only, but of the Soul
Oh I say now, these are the Soul!

Oh I must have you, or no one)

In honor of Jack's birthday tonight, I thought bring somebody here tonight that Jack can jack off to. Laughs)
No, with seriousness, are you ready? Ladies...
All the money, feel my temperature rising)

I saw the best minds of my generation destroyed by madness, starving hysterical naked
Dragging themselves through the negro streets at dawn looking for an angry fix
Angelheaded hipsters burning for the ancient heavenly connection to the starry dynamo in the machinery of night
Who poverty and tatters and holloweyed and high sat up smoking in the supernatural darkness of coldwater flats floating across the tops of cities contemplating jazz
Who bared their brains to Heaven under the El and saw Mohammedan angels staggering on tenement roofs illuminated
Who passed through universities with radiant cool eyes hallucinating Arkansas and Blakelight tragedy among the scholars of war
Who were expelled from the academies for crazy & publishing obscene odes on the windows of the skull
Who cowered in unshaven rooms in underwear, burning their money in wastebaskets and listening to the Terror through the wall
Who got busted in their pubic beards returning through Laredo with a belt of marijuana for New York
Who ate fire in paint hotels or drank turpentine in Paradise Alley, death, or purgatoried their torsos night after night
With dreams, with drugs, with waking nightmares

And so, from being created in his likeness, to being banished for wanting to be too much like him, we were cast out, and the garden of Eden transformed in to the garden of Evil
Los Angeles, The city of Angels, A land of Gods and Monsters, The inbetween realm where only the choices made from your free will, will decide your souls final fate
Some poets called it the entrance to the Underworld, but on some summer nights, it could feel like Paradise, Paradise Lost

Dear John forgive us our sins, dear John forgive us our sins
Master of the Universe, creator of all forgive us our sins
Dear John forgive us our sins, dear John

You ask me why I love her? Well give me time, I'll explain
Have you ever seen a Kansas sunset or an Arizona rain?
Have you ever drifted on a bayou down Louisiana way?
Or watched a cold fog come drifting in over San Francisco Bay?
Have you heard a bobwhite calling in the Carolina pines
Or heard the bellow of a diesel at the Appalachia mines?
Does the call of Niagara thrill you when you hear her waters roar?
Or do you look with awe and wonder, Massachusetts shore
Brave new men who stepped on Plymounth's rock?
And do you think of them when you stroll along a New York City dock?
Have you seen a snowflake drifting in the Rockies, way up high?
Or seen the sun come blazing down from a bright Nevada sky?
Do you hail to the Columbia as she rushes to the sea
Or bow your head at Gettysburg at our struggle to be free?
You ask me why I love her? I've got a million reasons why:
It's my beautiful America, beneath God's wide, wide sky

I came in hot
Made decisions beforehand
My mind made up
Things that would make me happy
To do them or not
Each option weighed carefully
A plan for each thought
And then I walked through the door past the open concept
And saw Violet bent backwards over the grass
Seven years old with dandelions grasped tightly in her hand
Arched like a bridge in a fallen handstand
Grinning wildly like a madman
With the exuberance that only doing nothing can bring
Waiting for the fireworks to begin
And in that moment I decided to do nothing about everything"

And the children let out from their school
I was standin' on a noisy corner
Waitin' for the walkin' green
Across the street, he stood
And he played real good
On his clarinet for free

Now me, I play for fortunes
And those velvet curtain calls
I've got a black Limousine and two gentlemen
Who escort me through these halls
And I'll play if you've got the money
Or if you're a friend to me
But the oneman band by thе quick lunch stand
He's been playin' real good for free

Nobody stopped to hеar him
Though he played so sweet and high
They knew he had never been on the TV
So they passed his music by
I meant to go over and ask for a song
Maybe put on a harmony
I heard his refrain as the signal changed
He was playin' real good for free"

My Bedroom is a Sacred Place Now – There Are Children at the Foot of My Bed,Lana Del Rae,Violet Bent Backwards Over the Grass,"{'year': 2020, 'month': 7, 'day': 28}","the beginning of my future poetry
I acknowledged who you really were for the first time
I didnt call you by any other name
I let you know that I knew the true nature of your heart
That it was evil, and that it convinced me that darkness was real
that the devil is a real devil
and that monsters dont always know that theyre monsters
But projection is an amazing thing
after you left and burnt the house down
you tried to convince me that it was I who was holding the matches
You told me that I didnt know who I was, but I do
I love rose gardens
I plant violets every time someone leaves me
I love the great sequoias of Yosemite
And if you asked my sister to describe the first thing she thinks of when she thinks of me
she would say camp fire smoke""
Im gentle
Im funny when Im drunk
But I havent been drunk for  years
I go on trips with my friends to the beach who dont know that Im crazy
I can do that
I can do anything
Even leave you
 Because my bedroom is a sacred place now that there are children at the end of my bed
telling me stories about the friends that they pretend to hate, that they will make up with later
And there are fresh cut flowers that I grew myself in vases from the yard on nightstands, hand carved by old pals from Big Sur
And the longer I stay here
the more I am sure
But the more I step into becoming a poet
The less I will fall into being with you
The more I step into my poetry
The less I will fall into being with you
The more I step into my poetry
The less I will fall into bed with you"

Some stories arent meant to be sold
Some words arent meant to be told
I want to leave them underneath the nightstand to be forgotten
or remembered should my thoughts come upon them in the middle of the night after a long beach day
Or by you, some afternoon, to thumb through with your worn warm afterwork hands
I love you, but you dont understand me, Im a real poet!
My life is my poetry, my love making is my legacy!
My thoughts are about nothing, and beautiful, and for free
You see, the things that cant be bought cant be evaluated, and that makes them beyond human reach
Untouchable, safe, otherworldy
Unable to be deciphered or metabolized
Something metaphysical,
like a view of the sea on a summer day on the most perfect winding road taken in from the car window
A thing perfect, and ready to become a part of the texture of the fabric of something more ethereal
 Like Mount Olympus, where Zeus sent Athena and the rest of the immortals to play"

Never to Heaven,Lana Del Rae,Violet Bent Backwards Over the Grass,"{'year': 2020, 'month': 7, 'day': 28}","may they never gaze as high as heaven, to ask why
May I never go where angels fear to tread
so as to have to ask for answers in the sky
The whys in this lifetime i've found are inconsequential
compared to the magic of the nowness - the solution to most
questions
there are no reasons
And if there are - i'm wrong
but at least i won't have spent my life waiting
looking for God in the clouds of the dawn
I'll be up early to rise though of course -
but only to make you a pot of coffee
That's what i was thinking this morning Joe
that it's times like this as the marine layer lifts
off the sea from the view of our favorite restaurant
that i pray that i may
always keep my eyes level to your eyeline
never downcast at the table cloth
You see, Joe
it's times like this that the marine layer lifts
off the sea on the dock with out candle lit
that i think to myself
there are things you still don't know about me
like sometimes i'm afraid my sadness is too big
and that one day you might have to help me handle it
 But until then
may my eyes always stay level to the skyline
assessing Long Beach's glittering new development
never higher than the tallest building
never to heaven or revenant
'Cause i have faith in man as strange as that seems
in times like these
and it's not just because of the warmth i've found in your
brown eyes
It's because i believe in the goodness in me
that it's firm enough to plant a flag in
or a
rosebud
or to build a new life."

Vernon
Rock quarry
The vastness of which has nothing on your beautiful mind
Dylan

I can see it in invisible ink like a tattoo
The ying to my yang
the toughness to my unending softness
A striking example of masculinity
firm in your verticality
sure in your confrontation against all elements
and duality
The sun to my wilting daisy
The earth to the wildflower that doesn't care where it grows

Vernon
everything's burnt here
there's no escaping it
the air is fried and on fire
I've never really fallen in love
but whatever this feeling is
I wish everyone could experience it
this place feels like a person
familiar
like someone I've stood next to before
but never while I was standing next to you
Thank you
for being here
for bearing witness to my vastness

Through the year I've called you in and out of my orbit
You, in your madness
the satellite that constellates my world
mimicking the inner chaos that I've disowned
a mirror to my past life retributions
and a reflection of my sadness
If I'm going to keep on living the way that I'm living
I can't do it without you
My feet aren't on the ground
I need your body to stand on
your name to define me
on top of being a woman
I am scared
and
ethereal
And

There are seven worlds in my eyes

I'm accessing of all them once

One to draw my words from and my muses
Another one I try and harness late at night that lies somewhere
off of the right of Jupiter
And then of course there's this one I live in
The land of a thousand fires
That's where you come in
You
Vernon
Dylan
Two blue steel trains running through the tunnels of your cool blue steel eyes

To guide me far from the world of my early days
That I can't quite make out clearly
That beckon me towards high sea cliffs
On long car rides

Towards a future place
A world unknown to me
Made up of something surreal and dripping
Flowers in solar systems oversized

You Vernon Dylan

No words needed to sponge up the dark nights
No explanations for the globes in my eyes
Shoulder to shoulder in the factory light
Letting me be who I would have been if everything had turned out alright
Three alternative endings
Now course through my blood on ice
But I thrive because I say I do
And because it's what I write

But honestly, if you weren't here with me
I don't know what things would look like

That's my why no matter what world I'm in
I'm accessible by only one satellite
Vernon
Dylan
And you in your madness

With two blue steel trains running through your cool blue steel eyes"

You were wearing your hair differently
Carrying the air differently
You said you wear your hair long parted in the middle
Long in solidarity just like all his women

In Long Beach

Aimless

Your fingers wiping oil on the paper with precision
With decision like an artist never seen yet with a vision

With a reason
Stared with venom at the ceiling
Not the grass
But straight ahead
Just at the skyline
With precision
Laser vision

Time was stopping
Moving through you
You dictated
by what moved you

Only moving, never thinking

Match to the sun thats slowly sinking
At the height of the afternoon
In the heat of the summer evening
Like a phoenix, like a chem trail, like a wavelength no ones claiming

Georgia o Keefe
Georgia peaches
Doing nothing but your painting
For forever
Forget teachers
Forgive him for ever leaving

Love is rising
No resisting
Cheeks are flushing
Now youre living
Say goodbye now
No resisting
Live your life like
No one's listening

Be the art the life is breathing
Be the soul the world is living

For you only
Not for giving
Just for taking
No one's listening

At the end of Rose and Rich
Down the street thats green and winding
Past the bushes cypress thriving
Past the chain link fence and driving
Further down the road less travelled
There you are athleisure wear unraveled
Now I see you clear

Standing stoic blue and denim
Eyes not blue but clear like heaven
You dont want to be forgotten

You just want to disappear"
Happy,Lana Del Rae,Violet Bent Backwards Over the Grass,"{'year': 2019, 'month': 2, 'day': 19}","And I am but not how you think
I live in a Tudor house
Under the freeway in Mar Vista by the beach
When you call I take my phone to the picnic table
That I bought from the Rose Bowl
And I listen to the rushing cars above
And I think about the last time you visited me
The last time we made love
How the noise got louder and louder during rush hour
Until it sounded like the sea
And it felt like the ocean was the sky
And that I was flying because you were two feet taller than me
Until you took me in your arms
And I could touch the stars
And they all fell down around my head
And I became an angel
And you put me to bed
Happy
People think that I'm rich and I am but not how they think
I have a truck with a gold key chain in the ignition
And on the back it says: happy,  joyous, and free
Happy
And when I drive
I think about the last time my friends were driving with me
How the radio was so loud that I couldn't hear the words
So we became the music
Happy
 They write that I'm rich and I am but not how they think
I have a safe I call the boyfriend box
And in it every saved receipt
Every movie theater ticket just to remind me
Of all the things I've loved and lost and loved again
Unconditionally
Happy
You joke that I'm rich and I am but not how you think
I live in a Tudor house under the freeway
Off of Rose Avenue,  blocks from the beach
And when you call I put your sweater on
And put you on speaker
And chat for hours underneath the trees
And think about the last time you were here lying next to me
How the noise from the cars got louder and louder
During rush hour
Until it sounded like a river or a stream
And it felt like we were swimming
But it wasn't just a dream
We were just

silver platters with strawberries strewn across the room

In Zimmerman with sandals on one summer dress to choose

Three girls
eyes rolled
loud laughter
dust specs lit by afternoon

My life is sweet like lemonade now there's no bitter fruit
eternal sunshine of the spotless mind
no thought of you

My thoughts have changed
my voice is higher
now I'm over you

No flickering in my head movies
projected in Bellevue

Because I captured the mood of my wish fulfilled
and sailed to Xanadu

The grief that came in waves that rolled I navigated through

The fire from my wish as wind to future trip to Malibu

now everything I have is perfect
nothing much to do

just perfect florals
green embroidered chairs
one dress to choose"

SportCruiser,Lana Del Rae,Violet Bent Backwards Over the Grass,"{'year': 2020, 'month': 7, 'day': 28}","Or parking on the block where our old place used to be
Genesee, genesee, genesee
Pathetic, I know - but sometimes I still like to park on that street,
And have lunch in the car just to feel close to you
I was once in love with my life here,
In that studio apartment with you
Little yellow flowers on the tops of trees as our only view,
Out of the only window,
Big enough for me to see our future through
But it turned out I was the only one who could see it
Stupid apartment complex
Terrible you
You, who I wait for
You, you, you
Like a broken record stuck on loop
So that day, on my birthday, I thought
Something has to change""
You cant always be about waiting for you
Dont tell anyone, but part of my reasoning for taking the flight class, was this idea that if I could become my own navigator
The captain of the sky,
That perhaps I could stop looking for direction
from you
 Well, what started off as an idea on a whim,
Has turned into something more
Too shy to explain to the owners that my first lesson was just a onetime thing
Ive continued to go to classes each week
At the precious little strip off Santa Monica and Bundy
And everything was going fine
We were starting with dips and loops
and then something terrible happened
During my fourth lesson in the sky
My instructor, younger than I, but as tough as you
Instructed me to do a simple maneuverer
Its not that I didnt do it,
But I was slow to lean the sports cruiser into a right hand upward turn
Scared, scared that I would lose control of the plane
Not tactfully and not gently
The instructor shook his head, and without looking at me said
You dont trust yourself”
I was horrified
Feeling as though Id somehow been found out
Like he knew me
How weak I was
Of course, he was only talking about my ability as a pilot in the sky
But I knew it was meant for me to hear those words
For me, they held a deeper meaning
I didnt trust myself
Not just , feet above the coast of Malibu
But with anything
And I didnt trust you
I couldve said something but I was quiet
Because pilots arent like poets
They dont make metaphors between life and the sky
In the midst of this midlife, meltdown, navigational exercise in selfexamination,
I also decided to do something else I always wanted to do
Take sailing lessons in the vibrant bay of Marina del Rey
I signed up for the class as Elizabeth Grant"",
And nobody blinked an eye
So, why was I so sure that when I walked into the tiny shack on Valley Way, someone would say
Youre not a captain of a ship, or a master of the sky!”
No, the fisherman didnt care, and so neither did I
And for a brief moment, I felt more myself than ever before
Letting the self proclaimed drunkard captains lessons wash over me like the foamy tops of the sea
Midway through my forehead burned,
and my hands raw from driving
The captain told me the most important thing Id need to know on the sea
Never run the ship into irons”
Thats nautical terms for not sailing the boat directly into the wind
In order to do that though, you have to know where the wind is coming from
And you might not have time to look up to the mast,
Or up further to the weathervane
So you have to feel where the wind is coming from
On your cheeks, and by the tips of the white waves from which direction theyre rolling
To do this, he gave me an exercise
He told me to close my eyes, and asked me to feel on my neck which way the wind was blowing
I already knew I was going to get it wrong
The wind is coming from everywhere, I feel it all over” I told him
No”, he said the wind is coming from the left. The portside”
I sat waiting for him to tell me You dont trust yourself”
But he didnt, so I said it for him
I dont trust myself”
He laughed gentler than the pilot, but still not realising that my failure in the exercise was hitting me at a much deeper level
Its not that you dont trust yourself” he said. its simply that youre not a captain. It isnt what you do”
Then he told me he wanted me to practise everyday so I would get better
Which grocery store do you go to?” he asked
To the Ralphs in the Palisades” I replied
Okay. When youre in the Ralphs in the Palisades,
I want you, as you're walking from your car to the store,
To close your eyes, and feel which way the wind is blowing
Now, I dont want you to look like a crazy person crouching in the middle of the parking lot,
but everywhere you go,
I want you to try and find which way the wind is coming in from
And then, determine if its from the port or starboard side,
So when youre back on the boat you have a better sense of it”
I thought his advice was adorable
I could already picture myself in the parking lot,
Squinting my eyes with perfect housewives looking on
I could picture myself growing a better sense of which way the wind was blowing
And as I did, a tiny bit of deeper trust also began to grow within myself
I thought of mentioning it,
but I didnt
Because captains arent like poets
They dont make metaphors between sea and sky
And as I thought that to myself,
I realized
thats why I write
All of this circumnavigating the earth,
Was to get back to my life
Six trips to the moon for my poetry to arise
Im not a captain,
Im not a pilot
I write!
I write"
Bare Feet on Linoleum,Lana Del Rae,Violet Bent Backwards Over the Grass,"{'year': 2020, 'month': 7, 'day': 28}","Stay on your path Sylvia Plath
don't fall away like all the others

Don't take all your secrets alone to your watery grave about
lovers and -

The secrets you keep will keep you in deep like Amy and -
And brother
And all of the people you meet on the street will reiterate lies
that they uttered

Leave me in peace, I cry
In the middle of the night
On a slow boat bound for Catalina for no reason

Tiny drops of perspiration dot my forehead
could be mistaken for dew drops if this were photo season

But alas this is a real life - and it's been a real fight just to
stop my mind from committing treason
Why you ask?
Because she told the townspeople I was crazy, and the lies, they
started to believe them

But anyways - that's all over now

I've moved on, gone scorched earth
And now I'm left wondering where to go from here
To Sonoma where the fires have just left?
South Dakota?

Would standing in front of Mount Rushmore feel like the Great
American homecoming I never had?

Would the magnitude of the scale of the sculptures take the place
of the warm embrace I've never got?

Or should I just be here now
Bare feet on linoleum
Slicing vegetables onto water that I will later turn
into stew

People love my stories
People love visions"
Paradise Is Very Fragile,Lana Del Rae,Violet Bent Backwards Over the Grass,"{'year': 2020, 'month': 7, 'day': 28}","and it seems like it's only getting worse
Down here in Florida
Were fighting red toxic tides
Mass of fish kills
Not to mention hurricanes and rising sea levels
Back in Los Angeles, things aren't looking much better
My treehouse that'd been standing for  years succumbed to the woolsy fire
Who wouldve thought that this year at 
You would've been taken out from under me
After all those years?
Built from the ground up, by hand, by your very first owner
Quiet World War One, aviation pilot
I tried to save you but the German Shepherd seemed more important
Paradise is very fragile,
and it seems like it's only getting worse
Our leader is a megalomaniac,
And we've seen that before
But never 'cause it was what the country deserved
 My friends tell me to stop calling  on the culture,
but it's either that or I  myself
They don't understand
I'm a dreamer
And I had big dreams for the country
Not for what it could do, but how it could feel
How it could think, how it could dream
I know
Who am I to dream for you?
Its just that in my own mind
I was born with a little bit of paradise
I was lucky in that way
Not like my husband
Who was born and raised in hell
I always had something gentle to give
All of me, in fact
Its one of the beautiful things about me
It's one of the beautiful things about nature
But lately Ive been thinking that I wish
Someone had told me when I was younger
More about the inhabitants that thrive off of paradise
That should they take too much,
There would be nothing left to give
Not everyone's nature is golden and green
And you can't fight what's in your nature
I got to thinking about it as
We were fighting the fires in Agora
But Im tired of fighting you
Paradise is very fragile,
and it's only getting worse
And every time I think of that,
I think about the curse bestowed upon Eve, that fateful eve,
She took that bite of fruit from that fruitful tree
And this summer night, you in front of me,
Makes me contemplate the origins of good and evil
Because you take and you take and you take and you take,
But you taste like the beach and a kiss
Candy from my eyes
In my veins you run citrus
Watercolor images of serpents on orange trees
Arise in my midst
Kundalini, you breathe me
I could do this forever
But my heart is very fragile,
and I have nothing left to give"

Tessa DiPietro,Lana Del Rae,Violet Bent Backwards Over the Grass,"{'year': 2020, 'month': 7, 'day': 28}","Except for a healer on th street in Ridgely
Tessa DiPietro,
recommended casually by a medium I no longer know
She said my number one problem was that my field was untrusting
When asked what to do, she paused and said Nothing”
Which sent me right into uncontrollable sobbing
Because theres never anything you can do about the important things
She said Okay, one thing you can do is picture the floor rising up to support you,
And sink into the back of the bed thats behind you
Too much of your energy is in front and above you”
Which, for some reason, made me think of a live show Id seen
Jim Morrison at the Hollywood Bowl, , check date
The blue trellis lights gave him an unusual aura
Like a halo or something
Made him  feet or taller
I remember just thinking he looked out of his body
but definitely like a god on stage
So I told her Maybe an artist has to function a little bit above themselves,
If they really want to transmit some heaven”
 And she told me
A singleness of focus is the key to transmission,
For an emphasis on developing inner intuition,
Close your eyes and feel where you hold your attention
If its in the back of your eyes
Walk it down to your hearts centre
and make that the new place from which your thoughts enter
Clairvoyance comes mostly from this simple function
Oh - and Jim died at 
So find another frame of reference
When youre referencing heaven
And have you ever read the lyrics to People are Strange’?
He made no sense!"""

Hi, my lovely, hi, my lovely
I am someone else
I did think I would live life alone
I was sure I was made out of stone
I have lost a lot but you helped me find
What was really real and some peace of mind
And I'm awfully thankful and I am so grateful
I need no one else
Will you think of me when I am gone?
Will you comfort me when I am wrong?

When at last you've found them you will understand as I
There is no solution
Life is without resolution

You must ask yourself what you really want in life
You must trust in me when I tell you it's alright
It's alright tonight
It's alright tonight

I remember New Year's that your everything seemed right
We had not made plans and we just drove all the whole night
Let's all go find a friend
Don't stop until the end

You must ask yourself, am I really the one?
You can't be of help if you can't have any fun
I'm your one if you want me to be
Please leave me be
Who are you to say a soul won't live forever
Yeah, yeah

Atop every mountain there's a hurdle in the sky
When at last you've found them you will understand as I
Each breath is sent from angels
These people, they are not strangers

You must ask yourself what you really want in life
You must trust in me when I tell you it's alright
It's alright tonight
It's alright tonight"

Though your dreams be tossed and blown

Walk on, walk on
With hope in your heart
And you'll never walk alone

If you dance, I'll dance, dada
I've got my eye on you
Say yes to Heaven
Say yes to me
Say yes to Heaven
Say yes to me"
Blue Jeans - Kris Menace Remix,Lana Del Rae,Blue Jeans (Remixes),"{'year': 2012, 'month': 5, 'day': 1}","Walked into the room, you know you made my eyes burn
It was like James Dean for sure
You're so fresh to death and sick as cacancer
You were sorta punk rock, I grew up on hip hop
But you fit me better than my favorite sweater
And I know that love is mean and love hurts
But I still remember that day we met in December, oh, baby
I will love you till the end of time
I would wait a million years
Promise you'll remember that you're mine
Baby, can you see through the tears?
Love you more than those bitches before
Say you'll remember, say you'll remember
Oh, baby, ooh
I will love you till the end of time
Big dreams, gangsta
Said you had to leave to start your life over
I was like, No, please stay here
We don't need no money, we could make it all work""
But he headed out on Sunday, said he'd come home Monday
I stayed up waiting, anticipating, and pacing
But he was chasing paper
Caught up in the game, that was the last I heard
I will love you till the end of time
I would wait a million years
Promise you'll remember that you're mine
Baby, can you see through the tears?
Love you more than those bitches before
Say you'll remember, say you'll remember
Oh, baby, ooh
I will love you till the end of time
You went out every night, and baby, that's alright
I told you that no matter what you did, I'd be by your side
'Cause I'ma ride or die, whether you fail or fly
Well, shit, at least you tried
But when you walked out that door, a piece of me died
Told you I wanted more; that's not what I had in mind
Just want it like before, we were dancing all night
Then they took you away, stole you out of my life
You just need to remember
I will love you till the end of time
I would wait a million years
Promise you'll remember that you're mine
Baby, can you see through the tears?
Love you more than those bitches before
Say you'll remember, say you'll remember
Oh, baby, ooh
I will love you till the end of time"
