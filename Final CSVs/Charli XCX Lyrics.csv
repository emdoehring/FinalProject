Always busy dreamin' 'bout boys, boys, boys XCX)
Head is spinnin' thinkin' 'bout boys

I need that bad boy to do me right on a Friday
And I need that good one to wake me up on a Sunday
That one from work can come over on Monday night
I want 'em all, I want 'em all
And when they finally leave me, I'm all alone but
I'm lookin' down and my girls are blowin' my phone up
Them twenty questions, they askin' me where I'm at
Didn't hit 'em back

I'm sorry that I missed your party
I wish I had a better excuse like
I had to trash the hotel lobby

But I was busy thinkin' 'bout boys, boys, boys
I was busy dreamin' 'bout boys, boys, boys
Head is spinnin' thinkin' 'bout boys

In every city I've got one with different ringtones
Flyin' from LA. all the way to Puerto Rico
My girls are callin' me askin' me where I'm at
Didn't hit 'em back
 
I'm sorry that I missed your party
I wish I had a better excuse like
I can't even lie, you got me

I was busy thinkin' 'bout boys, boys, boys

Don't be mad, don't be mad at me No, no, no, no)
Darling, I can't stop it even if I wanted
Don't be mad, don't be mad at me No, no, no, no)
Missed what you were sayin', I was miles away, yeah

Chemistry something like magic
You were with somebody else long term
And I was with somebody else as well
Met up late night by the Bowery
And in the morning we got coffee
Acting like strangers, and told no friends
It wasn't easy to pretend

And we know that it's wrong, but it feels real fun
Sneakin' around, fallin' deep in love
But sometimes I get scared
'Cause I know it's unfair
I'm hurting someone else instead

I'm breakin' every rule for you
You're breakin' every rule for me
I'm breakin' every rule for you
But I've gotta say
I want it this way
These moments really set me free

Straight away we started fallin'
Conversation never borin'
When your lips brushed up against my skin
All I wanted was to let you in
I wonder if people will notice
Said you find it so hard to focus
Cigarettes up on the balcony
Wrapped up in nothing but sheets

And we know that it's wrong
But it feels real fun
Sneakin' around, fallin' deep in love
But sometimes I get scared
'Cause I know it's unfair

Body tangled up in chains
I'm looking for the light in the misery
All this love is doomed to pain
Everyday, I feel the same

My tears, they cried like a waterfall in the light
My roses don't bloom since you left me blue
You've got to stop
Tryna mess around with my heart
It's true, I'm through, babe with you

I'm so over you
Tell me, baby, are you over me?
I'm so over you
Tell me, baby, will you ever regret me?
I'm so over you
Tell me, baby, are you over me?
I'm so over you
I promise, baby, that you will never forget me
 
Tryna fly away, tryna spread my wings
Soaring like a golden bird
Blocking out the things I heard
 girls on your cameraphone
Secrets kinda suck to burn
Wish I coulda heard it from you first ha ha ha ha)

My tears, they cried like a waterfall in the light
My roses don't bloom since you left me blue
You've got to stop

I promise, baby, that you will never forget me

Saw you at the party with everybody
You look so lonely when you're on your own
I know we both remember hanging together
We were so happy
Now we're moving on
I'm so over you
Tell me, baby, are you over me?
I'm so over you
Tell me, baby, will you ever regret me?

How can I fix what I fucked up?

It was boys and girls, and girls and boys
The Southern Comfort from your comforter got destroyed
It was shady eyes with the violent noise
We on the graveyard digging where the love is void
We had a meltdown underground
Just a cemetery chick, going solo now
But I still taste your bones when I'm all alone
You're the best I ever had, but now you got to go
And now I'm on my own
I said, Please, don't go""
Please don't go

How can I fix what I fucked up?

Hiding secrets in your bed

Money pours like the rain falls

Drums, bass, turn 'em up loud
Free fall, spinning around

Take the car and cut the brakes
Driving out into the dark
Even though I love mum and dad
I wanna swim out there with the sharks
I wanna learn to speak Japanese

We were made for a limousine
So get your shit now and come with me
 

Blowing bubbles out in the grass
All tangled in the stars, getting faded in the back seat
You can be hanging with us
We used to walk around the backstreets
Swimming pools with no heat
Fuck a dream, I want it for real
Always make it look so easy, moving to the city
Take a little sip of surreal
We're much more than nothing, yeah, we're all just trying to be who we feel

Throwing cake up in the air, we don't care, no
Surfing on a silver wave, wanna let go

I wanna run, be wild and free, and with my friends standing next to me

Keep on confessing your love for
Some other girl you would rather
I feel like a ghost in a white room
Your eyes keep starin' at me straight through
Only not to be two hearts goin' blind
One, two, three, so I kissed goodbye and left the room
Don't break my heart
This is when I lose my balance
This is when I lose all control
This is when I find the challenge
The challenge I can call my own
It's hard to fight a battle
When all my weapons are so far
Out of reach and balance
And I forget who you are
 I think I'm about to fall
I think I'm about to fall
I think I'm about to fall
Deeper and deeper, whoa
Deeper and deeper, whoa
Deeper and deeper, whoa
Deeper and deeper, whoa
Deeper and deeper, whoa

Better lie down and lay away
Have a heart facing foreign places
Tired of seeing love, tired of waiting

Ooh, But I keep on doing it
I ain't gonna stop until we're through with this
Ooh, But I keep on doing it
I ain't gonna stop until we're through with this

Hey, yeah, ohh

Hope you know I miss you
Know that I want to kiss you
You said that I was the bestest bitch that ever stuck with you
After all the shit we've been through
How come you cannot see through?
We're stuck on automatic
Never there when I really need you
This shit for real, this shit is danger
You come around my house
And you act like a motherfucking total stranger
Anytime that I see you, baby
Anytime that I see you, lately
Hoping I'm safe for a while
Safe for a while
 
Ooh, but I keep on doing it
I ain't gonna stop until were through with this
Ooh, but I keep on doing it
I ain't gonna stop until were through with this

Now what would I change to get you back to my arms again?
Instead that my life made you in love with a different man
If in my time you would pass my life
Could I still take you as my love
Tell me what I wanna do, tell what I gotta do better

Hey, yeah, ohh
Hey
Ooh*, but I keep on doing it
I ain't gonna stop until were through with this
Ooh*, but I keep on doing it
I ain't gonna stop until were through with this
Ooh*, but I keep on doing it
I ain't gonna stop until were through with this

But I like it
Yeah, I like it
You use your camera as an eye
Taking photographs of everything you see
Making the pain look better
You wear glitter on your face, look like a mess
Backcombed hair all over the place
Out in the fields drinking JD and Coke from plastic bottles
And I admire your individuality
MySpace, PhotoShop
Interesting captions that captivate me every time

You are an art bitch at heart
But it's wonderful, so beautiful, so amazingly lovely
And I love the way you hate love
It's so refreshingly nice to see it in your eyes
That you mean exactly what you say

You are an art bitch
With your plastic bees and your floral pattern dresses
You use your needle and a string to sew up your dreams
Of going to France or New York, or wherever it is
You're gonna get there one day
You hate bigbrand fashion, think it's shit
Like charity better, it's much more purer and original
Like your handwriting, which is backwards
And I admire your individuality
Strange kinda dancing like a rocknroll Najinksy
Bossa nova be pop like, like  years ago
 
You are an art bitch at heart
But it's wonderful, so beautiful, so amazingly lovely
And I love the way you hate love
It's so refreshingly nice to see it in your eyes

They love you in your photographs
They love you in your photographs
They love you in your photographs

Raise fires to keep them away
Keep a quick pace to make sure
Others must admire from a distance
I could make you wanna love me in an instant
Too nice, nicer than they are
But I learned being too nice won't get you too far
Explore everywhere on you
The journey can't hurt
Dominate every place, that's just how kings work
No commitment, no goal, no model
Wrong role, role models played a role
No shadow, no soul, let's go
 
Yeah, Im dancing in the darkness
Three years before I was feeling so heartless
But your burn shined through
Now Im drinking love potion when I lay next to you
Its a criminal feeling
Happiness cries when the tears are dreaming
My body is screaming
Im staying right here, no, Ill never be leaving

There are people in the industry
Or maybe it's not even in the industry
Like, this could be, like, applied to anyone's life
Whether they're working in, you know, art industry or not, you know
Um, you know how sometimes there's just those people
Who you know are fucking watching you
You know they're watching your every move
You know they're commenting on it behind your back probably in a kind of bitchy way
But then they're so nice to your face
And which is like, what the fuck, like
And they have so much criticism of you and the way that you do things
In almost kind of like an obsessive kind of a way
Where it's like they can't look away, you know
And don't get me wrong, I have had that feeling with other artists in my past
Not really right now, but, like, I definitely have, you know
Um, and I feel like it's like cyclical
Like it comes around, like, when you're feeling your strongest and most confident
Maybe you don't feel it, anyways, whatever
This song is kind of about that feeling of, like
I know you're fucking watching me, um
So, if you're fucking watching, I'm gonna be a fucking star""

This song is called Official

Hard to read, you could be OCD
You could be bad for me, you could say anything
Sometimes I get a bit TMI, little bit scared of heights
Little afraid to say
You know the things that make me smile
The face I make before my tears fall down
The things that I feel when you're acting suspicious
You know the place I run to hide
I take my problems there to work 'em out

The things that I say when you don't wanna listen
The things that you say when I make bad decisions
The things that we do by thе sink in my kitchen
I remembеr our first date
No chocolate and no bouquet
But the way that you kissed me
These are the things that could make us official

You guys sound good
 
Look at us, isn't it obvious?
Is it so dangerous? Is it so complicated?
You know the shapes my body makes
Under the sheets at  AM with you
The things that we break when we're switchin' positions
You know the words to my mistakes
You understand because you made 'em too

The things that I say when you don't wanna listen
The things that you say when I make bad decisions
The things that we do by the sink in my kitchen
I remember our first date
No chocolate and no bouquet
But the way that you kissed me
These are the things that could make us official

All of the things that we sometimes forget
All of the dreams that you put in my head
I'm still asleep, but there's breakfast in bed
These are the things that could make us official
Maybe the sky might not always be blue
All of my wishes will never come true
It doesn't matter 'cause I'm here with you
This stuff could make us official
So tell all your friends 'cause we're goin' official
Hey
Things that you say when I make bad decisions
Things that we do by the sink in my kitchen
I remember our first date
No chocolate and no bouquet
But the way that you kissed me
These are the things that could make us official
Sing it back to me, cmon!
These are the things that could make us official

Jungle (Phaeleh Remix),Charli XCX,Stay Away - EP,"{'year': 2011, 'month': 5, 'day': 15}","Youre beautiful with golden hair and black eyes
But youre alone, youre in the cold
So you hide

Young hearts, run free
Let our inhibitions be swinging through the vine trees
Young hearts, run free
You can drive me crazy, baby, baby

I want to
You want to
I want to
You want to

Youre beautiful with golden hair
But youre alone, youre in the cold
Young hearts run free
Young hearts run free

To the jungle
To the jungle
 
Oh, this could be our starting out, our wild lives
And as the wind blows through your hair, youll find
Young hearts run free
Young hearts run free

To the jungle
To the jungle
To the jungle

I want to
You want to
I want to
You want to

Go to thе jungle
