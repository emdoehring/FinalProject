How does it feel
To treat me like you do?
When you've laid your hands upon me
And told me who you are?

I thought I was mistaken
I thought I heard your words
Tell me how do I feel?
Tell me now, how do I feel?

Those who came before me
Lived through their vocations
From the past until completion
They'll turn away no more

And still, I find it so hard
To say what I need to say
But, I'm quite sure that you'll tell me
Just how I should feel today
See New Order Live

I see a ship in the harbour
I can and shall obey
But, if it wasn't for your misfortune
I'd be a heavenly person today

And I thought I was mistaken
And I thought I heard you speak
Tell me, how do I feel?
Tell me now, how should I feel?
Now I stand here waiting…

I thought I told you to leave me
While I walked down to the beach
Tell me how does it feel
When your heart grows cold?
Grows cold, grows cold, grows cold, grows cold)

Bizarre Love Triangle,New Order,Brotherhood,"{'year': 1986, 'month': 11, 'day': 6}","Every time I think of you
I feel shot right through with a bolt of blue
It's no problem of mine, but it's a problem I find
Living a life that I can't leave behind
There's no sense in telling me
The wisdom of the fool won't set you free
But that's the way that it goes and it's what nobody knows
Well, every day my confusion grows

Every time I see you falling
I get down on my knees and pray
I'm waiting for that final moment
You say the words that I can't say

I feel fine and I feel good
I'm feeling like I never should
Whenever I get this way, I just don't know what to say
Why can't we be ourselves like we were yesterday?
I'm not sure what this could mean
I don't think you're what you seem
I do admit to myself that if I hurt someone else
Then I'll never see just what we're meant to be
See New Order Live
Every time I see you falling
I get down on my knees and pray
I'm waiting for that final moment
You say the words that I can't say
Every time I see you falling

Something's got a hold on me
I get this feeling I'm in motion
A certain sense of liberty
I don't care, cause I'm not there
And I don't care if I'm here tomorrow
Again and again I've taken too much
Of the things that cost you too much

I used to think that the day would never come
I'd see the light in the shade of the morning Sun
My morning sun is the drug that brings me near
To the childhood I lost, replaced by fear
I used to think that the day would never come
That my life would depend on the morning Sun

When I was a very small boy
Very small boys talked to me
Now that we've grown up together
They're afraid of what they see
That's the price that we all pay
And the value of destiny comes to nothing

Something's got a hold on me
I get this feeling I'm in motion
A certain sense of liberty
The chances are we've gone too far
You took my time and you took my money
Now I fear you've left me standing
In a world that's so demanding

On a thousand islands in the sea
I see a thousand people just like me
A hundred unions in the snow
I watch them walking, falling in a row
We live always underground
It's going to be so quiet in here tonight
There's a thousand islands in the sea
It's a shame

And a hundred years ago
A sailor trod this ground I stood upon
Take me away everyone
When it hurts thou

From my head to my toes
From the words in the book
I see a vision that would bring me luck
From my head to my toes
To my teeth, through my nose

Regret,New Order,Republic ,"{'year': 1993, 'month': 4, 'day': 5}","Maybe I've forgotten the name and the address
Of everyone I've ever known, it's nothing I regret
Save it for another day, it's the school exam
The kids have run away

I would like a place I could call my own
Have a conversation on the telephone
Wake up every day, that would be a start
I would not complain of my wounded heart
I was upset, you see, almost all the time
You used to be a stranger, now you are mine

I wouldn't even trust you, I've not got much to give
We're dealing in the limits, and we don't know who with
You may think that I'm out of hand, that I'm naive, I'll understand
On this occasion it's not true
Look at me, I'm not you

I would like a place I could call my own
Have a conversation on the telephone

A fractured smile that soon dies

A savage mine had begun
A long farewell to your love and soul

So detached from the things we need

Something's got a hold on me
I get this feeling I'm in motion
A certain sense of liberty
I don't care 'cause I'm not there
And I don't care if I'm here tomorrow
Again and again I've taken too much
Of the things that cost you too much

I used to think that the day would never come
I'd see the light in the shade of the morning Sun
My morning sun is the drug that brings me near
To the childhood I lost, replaced by fear
I used to think that the day would never come
That my life would depend on thе morning Sun

When I was a very small boy
Very small boys talkеd to me
Now that we've grown up together
They're afraid of what they see
That's the price that we all pay
And the value of destiny comes to nothing
I can't tell you where we're going
I guess there was just no way of knowing
See New Order Live
I used to think that the day would never come
I'd see the light in the shade of the morning Sun

I feel so extraordinary
Something's got a hold on me
I get this feeling I'm in motion
A certain sense of liberty
The chances are we've gone too far
You took my time and you took my money
Now I fear you've left me standing
In a world that's so demanding

I used to think that the day would never come

I would not complain of my wounded heart
I was a short fuse burning all the time
You were a complete stranger now, you are mine
See New Order Live

I would like a place I could call my own
Have a conversation on the telephone
Wake up every day, that would be a start
I would not complain 'bout my wounded heart

Just wait till tomorrow
I guess that's what they all say
Just before they fall apart

I care so much for you
I'd crawl a thousand miles
Through deserts full of sand
