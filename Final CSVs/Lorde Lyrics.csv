Bloodstains, ball gowns, trashin' the hotel room

Is one girl swaying alone, stroking a cheek

Of the deeds outgrown and the welcome overstayed
And you're no better at swimming than you were in the beginning

We order different drinks at the same bars
I know about what you did and I wanna scream the truth
She thinks you love the beach, you're such a damn liar

Those great whites, they have big teeth
Hope they bite you
Thought you said that you would always be in love
But you're not in love no more
Did it frighten you
How we kissed when we danced on the light up floor?
On the light up floor

But I hear sounds in my mind
Brand new sounds in my mind
But honey I'll be seein' you 'ever I go
But honey I'll be seein' you down every road

But when you're withdrawn
It's the closest thing
To assault when all eyes are on you

Lick my lips, toss my hair
And turn the smile on
And the story's brand new
But I can take it from here
I'll find my own bravado

It's a pill tipped back, it's a moon eclipse, whoa
