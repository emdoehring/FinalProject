Hypotheticals,Lake Street Dive,Obviously,"{'year': 2021, 'month': 2, 'day': 11}","Obviously, we're at the beginning of something
I don't expect you to know where it's gonna go
But I believe we might be onto something
And I just thought maybe you should know

I've been playing out a lot of hypotheticals in my mind
I've been writing your name down next to mine
Been imagining all the things you and I could do
I've seen all the possibilities in my dreams
You're alone when you should really be next to me
Baby, let's not wait and see

Immediate action is unnecessary
It's a fatal attraction, it's a little scary
But I got a plan of attack
And I'll get us therе someday soon, I know it
I got a plan A and I got a plan B
And if it's absolutely necеssary, we'll go to plan C
Whatever I gotta do to be with you

I've been writing your name down next to mine
Been imagining all the things you and I could do
I've seen all the possibilities in my dreams
You're alone when you should really be next to me
Baby, let's not wait and see

Nobody can see into the future
Even the weatherman gets caught in the rain sometimes
But I see something in you that I've never seen before
And I can't be sure, no, maybe not
But I think it's worth a shot


Hypothetically, yes
Theoretically, forever
We'll see what happens
But I hope we will never be apart

Better Than,Lake Street Dive,Bad Self Portraits,"{'year': 2014, 'month': 2, 'day': 18}","I could spend ages reading the news
I could spend days singing the blues

But I turn up the TV light
Give up without a fight

Better than pretending
To know what's wrong and what's right

I could spend ages asking myself why
There's a million ways that I could say goodbye

But I turn down the lights
Come on, baby, come inside

Better than being
Some fool's bride
Better than pretending
To know what's wrong and what's right


Turn down the lights

I Can Change,Lake Street Dive,Free Yourself Up,"{'year': 2018, 'month': 4, 'day': 3}","Hate casts a long shadow
I know that I lie in it
And let it rule my mind from time to time
Escapin' an old battle
That clings on like a vine to me
Whispers dirty lies in my ear

I know we didn't start this fight
And I won't let it rule my heart tonight

I can change
I can change
I can still change
I can still change

Tracin' an old pattern
Drawing the lines from where I am and from where I wanna be
Forget that old adage
That history continues to keep us from a world we wanna see

I am scared that I won't get it right
But fear won't rule my heart tonight

I can change
I can change
I can still change

That you may be my problem, not my love

Would I be lying if I said you were too sweet
Though I'm quite sure you've got a bite?
I could say that you were just a special treat
Though we both know that's not right

And I am afraid to need you so
And I am too sober not to know
That you may be my problem, not my love
'Cause you go down smooth

Would it be true to say you go to my head
Or is that sentiment too frank?
Oh, I could say you make it sweet to go to bed
But then it's you that breaks the bank

And I am afraid to need you so
And I am too sober not to know
That you may be my problem, not my love

Trying to solve my mystery

Baby Don’t Leave Me Alone With My Thoughts,Lake Street Dive,Free Yourself Up,"{'year': 2018, 'month': 5, 'day': 4}","Hard times, hard times

For playin' along

Has got his little hands on the button
Feels like nothin' anyone can do
People out there crackin' up, crackin' up
And I'm just tryin' to keep it together
Notice that I feel better when I'm holdin' you

The demons of the night

Baby, don't leave me alone with my thoughts

Would you be my human shield?
Hold you so that I don't feel anything?
Hold you so that I don't feel the ringin' in my head?

Now I have to listen to my neighbors
Making love upstairs
From down on the ground floor
From down on the ground floor
From down on the ground floor
In this city all the humans live in layers
I've got people down the hall
And down the stairs
We all move in and out and live our lives
In stacks and rows and pairs
And try to find someone with whom we can share it
I can hear my neighbors making love upstairs
I wish I didn't have to be so well informed
Of their affairs
But if they have to be doing something
At least they're having fun
Sometimes I forget that all of us are only human
'Cause we're all stacked in rows and columns
And if one of them should fall on me
My neighbors making love upstairs would crush me
I'm down on the ground floor
I'm down on the ground floor
I'm down on the ground floor"

Time to pick my heart up off the floor
And when that love comes down
Without devotion
Well it takes a strong man baby

Elijah,Lake Street Dive,Lake Street Dive,"{'year': 2010, 'month': 11, 'day': 9}","And nary a girl in the world has been missed by his grip
He's long curly hair, that when wet, goes as far as his chin
And his knowledge of poets and punks is debatably thin
The thing I like most about him is what I see on the surface
Like two distant shores, we are bound by a love that's an isthmus
Oh Elijah!
Elijah, he lay in psychosis one bright sunny day
And even in sleep I cannot make myself walk away
So pretty was he, I said something I couldn't retract
And so for three years, he spent most of his time in the sack
Although it's November, I know we won't make it to Christmas
Like two distant shores, we are bound by a love that's an isthmus
Oh Elijah!
Elijah once told me in private that he'd like a break
Although he revealed through his actions that he was a fake
And so, then in public I told him that he's too dependent
And now to this day I maintain that I am unrepentant
All he can see through the tunnel is none of his business
Like two distant shores, we are bound by a love that's an isthmus
Oh Elijah!"

Is it just one thing you want from me?
I'm getting tired of this game
Everyone says the same damn thing
All your sweet talk sounding cheap
When I don't get what I need
My heart starts slowing its beat
Why don't you take me dancing Saturday with some drinks in the bar room?
Or maybe we could just stay home instead with some tapes and some Thai food
The thing is baby what I'm trying to stay is you ain't thinking this through
If you really want me, then you got me fooled
You know I hate to complain
But everyone wants the same damn thing
So when I give you a try
I get the same tired lines
I got to ask myself why"

Whenever I hold you tight

While your lips are close to mine
Will last forever

We sing along in the car
Wake before the sun
Another dawn
In the car
Who'll miss us when we're gone
Rolling along
In the car
Keeping awake
Keeping astray of
The feeling that everything has gone so wrong
But we're not alone
Filling the space of what we can't let go

With the radio on in the car
We've followed every sign and line upon our map
And now we're far from where we started
And we're not so brokenhearted

Don't paint me a picture, I'd rather write it on the wall

And what cards are gonna fall

Better not tell you, better not tell you now
And I'm gonna keep it

But baby actions speak louder than words
So I better not tell you, better not tell you

It's fairly hard to be patient waiting for the future to unfold
It's a keen observation saying the fortune favors the bold
I got a prime  if you could just give me you hand to hold
I would have no doubt, I could go all out
But when you lean in so close

Oh but I better not tell you, better not tell you now
I caught a feeling baby
Better not tell you, better not tell you now
We're up to the ceiling
Oh we could leave it in the hand of fate
Or baby we could take a leap of faith
Either way I better not tell you, better not tell you

I'll tell you everything

Don't take me to the grave
I'll be an old woman with somebody else by my side
But I will always be in love with you in my memories
When we werе twentyfive

I always think of you when I drink affogatos

The hot and cold was such a perfect combination
Melt all together bittersweet and creamy, and always gone to soon
