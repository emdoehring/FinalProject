Creep,Radiohead,Pablo Honey,"{'year': 1992, 'month': 9, 'day': 21}","When you were here before
Couldn't look you in the eye
You're just like an angel
Your skin makes me cry
You float like a feather
In a beautiful world

I wish I was special
You're so fuckin' special

But I'm a creep, I'm a weirdo
What the hell am I doing here?
I don't belong here

I don't care if it hurts
I wanna have control
I want a perfect body
I want a perfect soul
I want you to notice
When I'm not around

You're so fuckin' special
I wish I was special

But I'm a creep, I'm a weirdo
What the hell am I doing here?
I don't belong here
Ohoh, ohoh

She's running out the door
She's running out
She run, run, run, run
Run

Whatever makes you happy
Whatever you want
You're so fuckin' special
I wish I was special
But I'm a creep, I'm a weirdo
What the hell am I doing here?
I don't belong here
I don't belong here"

If I could be who you wanted

Let down and hanging around
Crushed like a bug in the ground

Shell smashed, juices flowing
Wings twitch, legs are going

It always ends up drivel

One day I am gonna grow wings
A chemical reaction
Hysterical and useless

Just as you write my number down
Just as the drinks arrive
Just as they play your favourite song
As your bad day disappears
No longer wound up like a spring
Before you've had too much
Come back in focus again
The walls are bending shape
They've got a Cheshire cat grin
All blurring into one
This place is on a mission
Before the night owl
Before the animal noises
Closed circuit cameras
Before you're comatose

Before you run away from me
Before you're lost between the notes
The beat goes 'round and 'round
The beat goes 'round and 'round
I never really got there
I just pretended that I had
Words are blunt instruments
Words are sawnoff shotguns
Come on and let it out
Come on and let it out
Come on and let it out
Come on and let it out
Before you run away from me
Before you're lost between the notes
Just as you take the mic
Just as you dance, dance, dance

A jigsaw falling into place
So there is nothing to explain
You eye each other as you pass
She looks back, and you look back
Not just once, and not just twice
Wish away your nightmare
Wish away the nightmare
You got the light, you can feel it on your back
A light, you can feel it on your back
Your jigsaw falling into place"

Fitter Happier,Radiohead,OK Computer,"{'year': 1997, 'month': 5, 'day': 21}","Fitter, happier, more productive
Comfortable, not drinking too much
Regular exercise at the gym three days a week
Getting on better with your associate employee contemporaries
At ease
Eating well
No more microwave dinners and saturated fats
A patient, better driver
A safer car
Baby smiling in back seat
Sleeping well, no bad dreams
No paranoia
Careful to all animals
Never washing spiders down the plughole
Keep in contact with old friends
Enjoy a drink now and then
Will frequently check credit at moral bank
Hole in wall
Favors for favors
Fond, but not in love
Charity standing orders
On Sundays ring road supermarket
No killing moths or putting boiling water on the ants
Car wash, also on Sundays
No longer afraid of the dark or midday shadows
Nothing so ridiculously teenage and desperate
Nothing so childish
At a better pace
Slower and more calculated
No chance of escape
Now selfemployed
Concerned, but powerless
An empowered and informed member of society Pragmatism, not idealism
Will not cry in public
Less chance of illness
Tires that grip in the wet
Shot of baby strapped in back seat
A good memory
Still cries at a good film
Still kisses with saliva
No longer empty and frantic
Like a cat
Tied to a stick
That's driven into
Frozen winter shit
The ability to laugh at weakness
Calm
Fitter, healthier and more productive

In a cage
On antibiotics"

Whilst on a walking holiday in remote regions
I chance upon a secluded valley
Away from the popular walking routes
Some distance along the valley
I come across a scene so breathtakingly beautiful
That I drop to my knees in wonder
There  is something about the serried ranks
Of deciduous and coniferous trees
Standing tall on the opposite bank
Of the river that sets my heart ablaze
The colours of the foliage are poetic
Whilst the arrangement of species seems divinely inspired
Clouds swoop and whirl above the topmost branches
And the river sparkles through an uncertain reflection below
Suddenly, the sky darkens, and along the river advances a flotilla of huge birds with menacing eyes
The size of the birds staggers me; one is as tall as a bus, and the others not much smaller
Their plumage is a shimmering blue
But their eyes are full of hate and looming disaster
With a horrible sinking feeling
I realise that the birds have noticed me
One of them clambers up the nearside bank
And waddles towards me
I take to my heels, and scramble along the path
Gaining speed, I run at full tilt
Then I see people in front of me, running towards me
First one passes, then another, then another
They are wideeyed with terror, and keep taking quick
Fearful looks behind them
There must, I realise, be something unutterably horrible in front of me, but my fear of the big birds compels me to carry on
More people run past me, all with the same frightened expression. They are running towards the birds, away from something unknown
I am running from the birds, towards something unknown. Not for the first time in my life, I curse my bad luck"

And shut the eyes in the cupboard

Keep an eye out for the neighbors
Anyway you turn
Ill be there
Open your skull
I'll be there
Climbing up the walls
I am the club and carving knife
We are friends til we die
You should not walk alone at night
You must show me your care
In the time when the lights go out
I am her face when she sleeps
I can't remember how it happened
Fifteen blows to the brain
I am the face on the news
I will strike when the- I will strike anytime
I will knock fifteen times
I have the smell of a local man
I can strike anytime
I am the pick in the ice in the quiet country lanes
I am the newspaper round
I am the eyes in the cupboard
I am the creak in the floorboards
I am the crack of the hammer
Overhead powerlines
I am the old, frightened
I am the years, ever... poording

Exploding gracefully, burning up the freeway

Grass is green at the edge of the bubble
Beautiful kids into beautiful trouble
Well, it seems to fall out of the sky and come down on you
Oh baby, burn

Fast Toyota, burns rubber
Useless rockers from England
Good times had by all
Just swallow your guilt and your conscience

Blue and white birds stepping hard on the pedal
Interstate Five runs straight down the middle
And it seems to fall out of the sky and come down on you
Oh baby, burn"
