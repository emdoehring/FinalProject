Evil,Interpol,Antics,"{'year': 2005, 'month': 1, 'day': 3}","Rosemary
Heaven restores you in life
You're coming with me
Through the aging, the fearing, the strife
It's the smiling on the package
It's the faces in the sand
It's the thought that moves you upwards
Embracing me with two hands
Right will take you places
Yeah, maybe to the beach
When your friends, they do come crying
Tell them now your pleasure's set upon slow release

Hey, wait
Great smile
Sensitive to fate, not
Denial
But hey, who's on trial?

It took a life span with no cell mate
The long way back
Sandy, why can't we look the other way?
 
He speaks about travel
Yeah, we think about the land
We smart like all peoples
Feeling real tan
I could take you places
Do you need a new man?
Wipe the pollen from the faces
Make revision to a dream while you wait in the van

Hey, wait
Great smile
Sensitive to fate, not
Denial
But hey, who's on trial?

It took a life span with no cell mate
By the long way back
Sandy, why can't we look the other way?
You're weightless, you are exotic
You need something for which to care
Sandy, why can't we look the other way?

Leave some shards under the belly
Lay some grease inside my hand
It's a sentimental jury
And the makings of a good plan
You've come to love me lightly
Yeah, you come to hold me tight
Is this motion everlasting
Or do shudders pass in the night?
Rosemary
Oh, heaven restores you in life
I spent a life span with no cell mate
The long way back
Sandy, why can't we look the other way?
You're weightless, semierotic
You need someone to take you there
Sandy, why can't we look the other way?
Why can't we just play the other game?
Why can't we just look the other way?"

We can cap the old times, make playing only logical harm
We can cap the old lines, make playing that nothing else will change

But she can read, she can read, she can read, she can read
She's bad
She can read, she can read, she can read, she's bad
Oh, she's bad

But it's different now that I'm poor and aging
I'll never see this face again
You go stabbing yourself in the neck

And we can find new ways of living
Make playing only logical harm
And we can top the old times
Claimmaking that nothing else will change

You go stabbing yourself in the neck
But it's different now that I'm poor and aging
I'll never see this place again
And you go stabbing yourself in the neck

It's in the way that she posed
It's in the things that she puts in my head
Her stories are boring and stuff
She's always calling my bluff
She puts the, she puts the weights into my little heart
And she gets in my room and she takes it apart
She puts the weights into my little heart
I said she puts the weights into my little heart
She packs it away
She packs it away
She packs it away
She packs it away
She packs it away
She packs it away

It's in the way that she walks
Her heaven is never enough
She puts the weights in my heart
She puts, oh, she puts the weights into my little heart"

Stella Was a Diver and She Was Always Down,Interpol,Turn on the Bright Lights,"{'year': 2002, 'month': 8, 'day': 20}","This one's called Stella Was a Diver and She's Always Down""

When she walks down the street
She knows there's people watching
The building fronts are just fronts
To hide the people watching her

But she once fell through the street
Down a manhole in that bad way
The underground drip
Was just like her scuba days

Days
Daze
Days
Daze

She was all right 'cause the sea was so airtight, she broke away
She was all right 'cause the sea was so airtight, she broke away
She was all right but she can't come out tonight, she broke away
She was all right 'cause the sea was so tight, airtight
She broke away, broke away
She broke away, broke away
She broke away, broke away
She broke away
 
She lies in no place
She lies in nowhere
She lies in no place
She hides in nowhere
She hides in nowhere

At the bottom of the ocean she dwells
At the bottom of the ocean she dwells
From crevices caressed by fingers
And fat blue serpent swells

Stella, Stella, oh Stella
Stella I love you, Stella I love you, Stella I love you

She was all right 'cause the sea was so airtight, she broke away
She was all right 'cause the sea was so airtight, she broke away
She was all right but she can't come out tonight, she broke away
She was all right, yeah, the sea was so tight, airtight
She broke away, broke away
She broke away, broke away
She broke away, broke away
She broke away
Well, she was my catatonic sex toy, lovejoy diver
Well, she was my catatonic sex toy, lovejoy diver
She went down, down, down there into the sea
Yeah, she went down, down, down there
Down there for me, right on
Oh yeah, right on
So good, oh yeah, right on
So good, oh yeah

There's something that's invisible
There's some things you can't hide
Trying to detect you when I'm sleeping
In a wave you say goodbye
There's something that's invisible
There's some things you can't hide
Trying to detect you when I'm sleeping
In a wave you say goodbye"

Thought I knew which one to wear

Leif Erikson,Interpol,Turn on the Bright Lights,"{'year': 2002, 'month': 8, 'day': 20}","She says it helps with the lights out
Her rabid glow is like braille to the night
She swears I'm a slave to the details
But if your life is such a big joke, why should I care?

The clock is set for nine but you know you're gonna make it eight
So that you two can take some time, teach each other to reciprocate

She feels that my sentimental side should be held with kids' gloves
But she doesn't know that I left my urge in the icebox
She swears I'm just prey for the female
Well then hook me up and throw me, baby cakes, 'cause I like to get hooked

The clock is set for nine but you know you're gonna make it eight
All the people that you've loved, they're all bound to leave some keepsakes
I've been swinging all the time, think it's time I learned your way
I picture you and me together in the jungle, it would be okay

I'll bring you when my lifeboat sails through the night
That is supposing that you don't sleep tonight
It's like learning a new language
Helps me catch up on my mime
If you don't bring up those lonely parts
This could be a good time
It's like learning a new language
You come here to me
We'll collect those lonely parts and set them down
You come here to me

I'm lonely
You lack the things to which I relate
But I see no harm
Come wait, come wait, come wait
It's over
Yeah, one, two, three, do me

When I'm feeling lazy, it's probably because
I'm saving all my energy to pick up when you move into
My airspace
Move into my airspace
And something's coming over me, I see you in the doorway
I can't control the part of me that swells up when you move into
My airspace

Better than seven other men
Wayward from women who break dimensions

The next artery
Splendid, I bled my whole life

We rejoice because the hurting is so painless
From the distance of passing cars
But I am married to your charms and grace

And celebrate the myriad ways that I love you

She swears I'm a slave to the details
But if your life is such a big joke, why should I care?

The clock is set for nine but you know you're gonna make it eight
So that you two can take some time, teach each other to reciprocate

She feels that my sentimental side should be held with kid gloves
But she doesn't know that I left my urge in the icebox
She swears I'm just prey for the female
Well then hook me up and throw me, baby cakes, 'cause I like to get hooked

The clock is set for nine but you know you're gonna make it eight
All the people that you've loved they're all bound to leave some keepsakes
I've been swinging all the time, think it's time to learn your way
I picture you and me together in the jungle it would be ok

I'll bring you when my lifeboat sails through the night
That is supposing that you don't sleep tonight
 
It's like learning a new language
Helps me catch up on my mime
If you don't bring up those lonely parts
This could be a good time

I would gladly give my life to be there
To be there

All that we've got to be is candid and gentle
To be certified, and I've really loved to mentor
Sometimes it's hard to be expansive
Need to free some light to enter, reflections ethereal to render

I see you in everything, I see you in everything
I see you in everything, I'll be there
I see you in everything, I see you in everything
I see you in everything, in my truly vacant heart
I see you in everything, I see you in everything
I see you in everything, I'll be there, I'll be there
I see you in everything, I see you in everything
I would gladly give my life to be there
I'll be there $"
Everything Is Wrong (Solomun Stripped Remix),Interpol,Everything Is Wrong,"{'year': 2015, 'month': 4, 'day': 18}","Sleeker and cheaper, the wind changed
Following deeper, they hear what I say
Spectral incentives have paved the way
I think I know why I say what I say
Inverse achievements, I rue the days
Am I more soulful? Am I coming down now?
Can we start over as agents of peace?
We're taking a part of both of us, but nobody likes to wait
Everything is wrong, truly wrong, everything is wrong
Everything is wrong
Truly real , truly, truly, truly real)
Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on
Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on
We made our home without begging your pardon
We made our home with time alone
It's taken apart the best of us and nobody likes to wait
Everything is wrong, truly wrong, everything is wrong $"
My Desire (Remixed By Man Without Country),Interpol,El Pintor Remixes,"{'year': 2016, 'month': 4, 'day': 16}","I'm a frustrated man
Summon us for peace
Do what we can
Feel my desire
Favor the bold
Some of us fall to the Earth
These others roam
Besieged by desire
Be my desire
I'm a frustrated man
Summon us for peace
Do what we can
See my desire
No solemn moods
All of us are teammates
We stick to the rules
We stick to the rules
Come on baby
It's time for a change of heart
Come on baby
It's time for a change of heart
Come on baby
That looked like your chance to me
 I've been there
I've been here
Erased
I've been here
I've been here
Come on baby
Come on baby
It's time for a change of heart
Come on baby
Come on baby
That looked like your chance to me
Come on baby"

I was on my way
Chasing my damage
I was chased, thrilled and altered

Because I was chased, thrilled and altered

And style was worthwhile
Because I was

At least try hold the other
In the right light
This sky's gonna break
Some of us die heroes
At least they'll never suffer
At least they'll
See the ocean
Cause I could go anywhere
I could go anywhere
So free in my place in the sun
Cause I could go anywhere
You know all about me
That's what's so frightening
You know all about me
Seems my moon is travelling
We try to engage
Softened up by peace
At least I had my taste
Of the nightlife
Be kind to the babes
Cause someday you might need them
At least they'll never suffer
At least they'll always
 See the ocean
Cause I could go anywhere
I could go anywhere
So free my nature to run
Cause I could go anywhere

You know all about me
That's what's so frightening
You know all about me
Seems my moon is travelling
You know all about me
That's what's so frightening
You know all about me
Seems my moon is travelling
Always
See the ocean
Cause I could go anywhere
Besides my only care's me
My face in the sun
Cause I could go anywhere"
