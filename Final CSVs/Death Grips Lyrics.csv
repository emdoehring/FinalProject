Beware,Death Grips,Exmilitary ,"{'year': 2011, 'month': 4, 'day': 25}","He come to me with money in his hand! He offered me, I didn't ask him, I wasn't knocking someone's door down, I was running from that! When I got out, I was in that. I was already through that, I had that, I had the studio, I went to the studio! I went to Vox Studios. I had it all, and I looked at it and said: 'This is a bigger jail than I just got out of.'
I don't want to take my time going to work, I got a motorcycle and a sleeping bag and ten or fifteen girls! What the hell I wanna go off into – and go to work for? Work for what, money? I got all the money in the world!
I'm the king, man, I run the underworld, guy! I decide whose does what, and where they do it at! What am I, gonna run around and act like I'm some teenybopper somewhere, for somebody else's money? I make the money, man, I roll the nickels, the game is mine!
I deal the cards
Beware, God is watching
God is watching
I close my eyes and seize it Seize it)
I clench my fists and beat it Beat it)
I light my torch and burn it Burn it)
I am the beast I worship
I close my eyes and seize it Seize it)
I clench my fists and beat it Beat it)
I light my torch and burn it Burn it)
I am the beast I worship

And I know soon come my time
For in mine void a pale horse burns
But I fear not the time I've taken
Past the point of no return
Wage war like no tomorrow
'Cause no hell, there won't be one
For all who deny the struggle
The triumphant overcome
God is watching, God is watching)

Trips to where few have been
Out of thin air, upon high winds
Rites begin when the sun descends
Have felt what few will ever know
Have seen the truth beneath the glow
Of the ebb and flow, where the roots of all mysteries grow
I am below, so far below the bottom line
Transmitting live, transmissions rise
From the depths out of controlled by
Suspended glance of an unblinking eyes
Imminent gaze cast 'pon the path that winds
'Pon the path I find, and claim as mine
To ride the waves of unrest
Made to make me shine as a testament
To why the ways of the blind will never get
Shit but shanked by my disrespect
Dismiss this life, worship death
Cold blood night of serpent's breath
Exhaled like spells from the endlessness
In the bottomless wells of emptiness
Channeled to invoke what we represent
Secret order, elitist horde of creeping fire, seizing power
Riders of the lupus hour
Eye on palm, time is gone
Moonlight drawn, fly till dawn
Sacrifice to rise beyond
Deep inside the violent calm of the coming storm
In blood sworn to glorify and for life adorn
With all that dies to become unborn
God is watching, God is watching)
I close my eyes and seize it Seize it)
I clench my fists and beat it Beat it)
I light my torch and burn it Burn it)
I am the beast I worship God is watching)
I am the beast I worship
I close my eyes and seize it Seize it)
I clench my fists and beat it Beat it)
I light my torch and burn it Burn it)
I am the beast I worship
I am the beast I worship God is watching)
In the time before time eyes 'bove which horns
Curve like psychotropic scythes
And smell of torn flesh bled dry
By hell swarms of pestis flies
Vomiting forth flames lit by
An older than ancient force
That slays this life with no remorse
The spiral storm of flames inside
The torch I raise, the force I ride
Feel my vessel go up in flames
Flesh torch lit by the unnamed
Direct connection to the source
Vestment of unnatural force
Forever burning black torch
Wisdom of the old and true
Possessed by the chosen few
Shining to reveal the ways
Of a darkness that pervades
All that is and ever was
Inferno of witches' blood
Worship is not on bended knee
Nature knows not of mercy
To pray is to accept defeat
Power pisses on the weak
Bow and beheaded by the beast
Beggar on a bitch's leash
Scum is desperate for relief
Worship is the way I ride
Witching currents through the eye
Of storms that force the false to die
Worship the flames with which I rise into apocalyptic skies
Beware, God is watching
Harsh winds flay mine flesh to bone
In splintered skeleton I roam
Wastelands with naught to call my own
But the path I walk alone
The hunger burns within my gut
As my bones turn into dust
God is watching, God is watching)
And I know soon come my time
For in mine void a pale horse burns
But I fear not the time I'm taken
Past the point of no return
Wage war like no tomorrow
'Cause no hell, there won't be one
For all who deny the struggle
The triumphant overcome

I close my eyes and seize it
I clench my fists and beat it Beat it)
I light my torch and burn it
I am the beast I worship
I close my eyes and seize it
I clench my fists and beat it Beat it)
I light my torch and burn it
I am the beast I worship
Beware, God is watching)
I am the beast I worship
Beware, God is watching)

I'm on a journey to the center of three

While everybody's like Nooooo!)
I got this pregnant snake; stay surrounded by long hairs
A plethora of maniacs and spiral stairs

Sink or swim, who fucking cares, cut the birth cords
Press send, yeah, thick
Gaga can't handle this shit, headed for the Sammy Davis wing
Throw up a black hole at the entrance of LinensnThings

'Cause even if you did, bet youd keep coming back
Back for more, need it man you're addicted to the heat

Spinning exorcist like planets out of orbit off the edge
Off mine axis whipping through doors to far more than all thats ever been said, yuh

What's going on? Where's it at?
Make some calls to make it crack, let's see
I need money, drugs, a ride
And a spot with hot ones inside
The mission:

To get all of the above in a limited amount of time
I can do this and it's done
Like that we're on our way
Be it acid on the tongue
Cocaine in your brain
Or some weed that hits your lungs
Like a runaway train
Hell yeah, from DMT to MDMA
Got all that shit and more
So till dawn we're okay, but anyway

Fuck a line, every time
Get in, get a drink, and lose our minds
All eyes on the dime
That makes your dick want to grind
Know you got a good buzz going
Cause everything is glowing
Skirt so short her ass is showing
And she's looking so youre knowing
You could get it tonight
But theres so much around
Best take your time, do it right

As you keep getting higher
Lights look like they're on fire
Soon all thats left of you
Is your most primal desires
Ass clappin', dick suckin', lock the door to the bathroom – quick fuckin'
Find a whore and it could happen
But it's nothin', cause you're drunk and you'll be blackin' out
Before you even get a chance to think 'bout what you're doing

I want it, I need it, need it to make me feel heated

In the groove that has the whole party movin'
You're cruisin', you don't know what you're doing and you don't give a-
Cause you're so liquored up, you throw it up
And keep on riding cause your timing is on
And that fine one is on you, it's time to get gone
Too far up in it to yawn, till it's finished come on
Get more twisted and bomb the dance floor till it breaks
Start to pondering rape
Me, I'm all about the face
But it takes all kinds
So pay no mind to the taste
Want to hear that song?
You know, the one with the bass
That makes their asses gyrate
Forget to hydrate
Till they're so fucked up they take
Off all of their clothes and whip
It on me like my body's made to fit 'tween their lips
You got the ones on their grill
Or between their hips
But either way, I must say
I really don't give a shit
Long as it's done well, and they promise not to tell
We could do this like an orgy
In the bowels of hell
Where every Lucys hella horny
And their pussies don't smell
Argh...
Where's it at?

Responsibility's cool, but theres more things in life
Like getting your dick
Rode all fucking night
By the kind of girl that knows how to keep her shit tight
Legs in the air, looking like they feel nice
Volcano pussy melt your peter like ice
And the drugs got you going back for more cause you're like
I just can't get enough of that cum clutch, well alright
It's time to find one and take one
Right now
It's time to find one and make one say
I'm down""
Think I just found one, 'bout to break one off
Meanwhile

Hallucinating crazy, getting lost for miles
May have gotten too fucked up cause I forgot how to smile
Gonna have to do this shit Jim Morrison style
Will it work? Probably not, but it's worth a try

First hot one I see with sex in her eyes
Will be the hot one I need to take home with me tonight
Wish me luck, give me dap
And I'll talk to you later
And when I do, let's hope my story isnt all about haters
Where's it at? Cause I want it like, man
Got the drugs but need a hot one that'll make me go damn
Was the most banging guts that I ever have smashed
If you got it push it up on me cause I'm feeling that ass, know what I mean?
Where's it at?

Intangible intrusion to the bone, through the bone
Feels human bones, human skill
Blessed on windmill and opium feel

Rabbit holes that last for years

I bum a dialogue instead of renting it
Call in the place and get an estimate
It's diligent on paper, I'll invest in it
Be weird if I could make it as a mesmerist
Have a tall list of clients to tamper with
Be a practicing confessional
Cultivator of masochists
Crave sanity? I'll make you vegetables
Your family'll thank me like pacifists

Came to in a sports cage
Five minutes, coulda swore it was a decade
Had the time of my life, no head case
Zoom with the camp where we jump for fuck's sake
Threw it off over end of the hard way
Lie back, then I shut down my heart rate
Enter threshold of blind man's hallway
Hell'll turn a tightrope to my causeway
Two burned rascals call me hombre

I'm before all your destinations, I'll be on display
Im fuckin' on your schedule, explanations in delay
Pathway enchanted encounter, feed that hoe a chainsaw
Burned up at myself, back to the floor

Pull that way, run your vehicles 'cause you know it's cool
Put my fist on a pedestal 'til I stroke the core

Don't matter who you shot, there's no scars where you are

Desert creek kumbaya, feed that snake like mud

Question must be scroungin'
Nobody came to flex, it's poundin'
But I bet that's next, the mountain flecks
Off this map's rips, it's grounded
By the thousands, they walked in the valley
Act like you care while I get you out of it

I bide my time like fuck in place
One day, I'll wave sun to ice
Watch its kind get thrown like rice
My cackle stretch out like thunder
So fucking loud, it's vulgar

I pull my face out the dirt slow
These days I only wake up third of the way, narco
Held to deep rapid eye move, hold

Gun my chances, closed road, no road left to travel

I know what this calls for
Where's my scalpel? Operation cut

My internal war blows, like freezing fog in Oslo
Frozen, I can't get soft, baptized in hoarfrost
Like carbon monoxide garage
Freeze your blink like sandman's flush
I hate you so much
I hate your laws
I hate your need a cause
I hate your faux touch
I hate every last one of you
I ponder digesting razors, just to be done with you
I love you so much

I'm triple the motherfucker
Mondofisted, full of backwards
From banana town manor
My slang step like legless lizard
I fuck around, fashion a rocket
Shoot to Mercury, for the winter
Extended vacation till I decompose on my splinters

Sometimes feel like I'm close but never get there, never get there
Does it mean I'm a ghost if I'm still here? Wanna leave here
And if I am why can't I just float through the walls? Through the walls
And if I can, were they even ever there at all? Not at all
Too much time spent in the maze will drive you mad, I feel so bad
Been there so long I can't remember who I am, or where I stand
But in the end I guess I just dont give a damn, twist a gram
And keep on sticking with the original plan, fuck it man
Judge you no more than I wish to be judged, even on the low
But I do know what you do not speak of, dont know but it shows
Try to hide but I see who you are because I just know
Keep talking but you already said too much, there you go
How it is now's how it always was, thats on my blood
How it is now's how it always was, thats on my blood

See my blood spill drip, by chances
Try to chill, quit, cause I can't just slip into a zagthoth trance
Tongue hissing, serpent chants
Come again work it in, yeah just like that
We paint our insides black as the shadows 'hind our flesh
And make all that we lack, the part of life that we forget
All praise due to the fact that we've forgotten how to sweat it
Check it, bring it, kill it
On everything I own, swear would rather slit my throat
And die on the run than be the one who ends up hangin' from that rope
Tied to the thumb of the man who comes to empty your pockets when you choke
Got to get that shit myself and get the fuck out of this game before
I end up getting stuck with no one but myself to blame, all the way insane
Staring at the ceiling, in the dark
Trying not to let the feeling, tear you apart
But the silence is buzzing, and it won't stop
Tell yourself it's almost over, but it's not

There
Over, over
Th-, there
Over, over
Th-, there
Over, over
There
Over, over"

Cardiac over cancer, don't gimme no suffer
Steal me over feel me linger, until I'm six under
Ain't a fucking thing sacred, when I get naked
It's death!

I'm lighting up like Vegas
All sevens king of pentacles
I'm chaining like it's money, dirty money, surgeons general
As if my flesh keeps me prisoner
As if
I've been spinning chambers since the day I was born
Like, what's it all for?
Like, why the fuck not?
Fuck if I don't get off I don't know how to be caught

I get off at all costs
I'm turned off
Pahpow, pahpow
I'll fuck you off at no cost
You're turned off
Pahpow, pahpow
I'm turned off won't be back soon
Look up see my nuts slap the moon
I'm turned off like a myth
Can't look me up, I don't exist
I spin the chamber 'tween my lips
I pull the trigger like a gif
I can't get hit, I've never lost
I'm a rumor, I'm turned off

My footprint precedes me follow me
I'm all the way over my species
My footprint so dropped it's bottomless
Species call my redwings apocalypse
You want this bitch I drop a bitch
Snuff your bloodclot metropolis
Trail of anonymous casualties
Pah pow boom, mastery
I've been over that glass house
All my windows blacked out
Straight jacked up, the fuck up
Guts up man down
My man stand down
I'm not with it
I drop liquid

You run for martyr
While I'd push harsher
Lose it more further
Lose it more nerder

Swing the door open and buck 'em down

But nevermind the way it sound
Everytime we make it pound
Straight into the pavement now
Whip it, bleed it, cause it pain
Eat it, shit it out and change

To them petty pussy brains
Push me and they will be slain

Own it till shit goes up in flames

Howling on that mountain peak

Ever see you in my life
Steadily to the death passing

Makes your passions taste so stale

Little pinot pouring out my gills
Pass a carafe, perhaps Ill swill
My grief may leak but cant congeal

Till last drop wind through mine like scales
Compromise your position, become theirs

Day breaking, glyph hissing
Sanity fucking, bitch skinning
How do you say come to me
Hanging out with Linda
I heard shes in fucking custody

Need new escape were a trained magician
Ive just the uranium griffin
Land you there in ribbons
Where your thoughts stay hidden
Fair for a square made soft for digging

Amp cooking guilt gives a thunder stealing window licker
Her moods big for real
Head hunting, blunt kissing, death dumping, body gripping

Downs you with dull pain, won't we become strange?
Tied up with your legs, hide helps, on the way
Who will help you fall? It's just all so frail
So long since we fell, still don't know we failed
Go for the most tears, stay cause it gets strange
Went there to shed years, left there in lead chains
Been there since next year, scarred us to death chair
Scared us to rest less, skull full of house guests

Like ribs of vampire, like winds on high wire
Whips you like it cares, push you down more stairs
Kicks you for quick laughs, don't cry, you won't last The fear)
Missing entire weeks, months gone as I peak
Lost tongue, mystery, everyone's on to me The fear)

Hates me till it heals, wakes me with the chills The fear)

Like one percent and pleasantries
Gather your things bolt till you reach
The crystal fields of ketamine
I'll meet you there, I'll beat you there
Bet I'll be there before you leave
Time you get there Ill be midair
Like peace of mind's a bore to me
The fear, the fear
Jump, jump
Don't jump!

When the rail holds you, flight like stairs grows you
Off your mind must wish, this is not my ditch
Ah that ditch wears you, host torn and worn through
Hard looks at blank walls, held way too long pause

Into lakes they're crying, I keep spitting
Wish I could see them dying, but my peaks too fucking misty
Tilt your lump, till back of your brains 'tween your weak slumped shoulder blades
Still can't scope peak I pave into oneway street to space
Grovel in gravel at my base, while saddle control you seek

Rage stormin' off the chains

Your cadence is sloppy
Can't break me, I got me
You're grave stink, I'm lofty
You're lady like loli

Sometimes I give no reply and watch your ice break like a jaw
Don't waste your breath, the time was over before it started
When you arrived, I had already departed

Called the worm, just got high
Klepto war hand on the ride
Never answer when they hit me, why
Never matter, pass on the lie
'Bout what happens after we die
Dust to ash, ashes to malt
Ghost all black, control the zone
The troll is threshed, I'm forced to ride
Lock your door, argent clear
All the dead is souls galore
We just got spit in your eyes
Rabid dogs off the leash
From man to man as we beef
Get the fuck out of that Jeep
All hell leave I lead the sting

So love battle, took the mantle
From the dogs who want more beef
For the law, code of the streets
With every oomph, we'll sue the pigs

Told ride through the sky of black mist

What's going on? Where's it at?
Make some calls to make it crack, let's see
I need money, drugs, a ride
And a spot with hot ones inside
The mission:

To get all of the above in a limited amount of time
I can do this and it's done
Like that we're on our way
Be it acid on the tongue
Cocaine in your brain
Or some weed that hits your lungs
Like a runaway train
Hell yeah, from DMT to MDMA
Got all that shit and more
So till dawn we're okay, but anyway

Fuck a line, every time
Get in, get a drink, and lose our minds
All eyes on the dime
That makes your dick want to grind
Know you got a good buzz going
Cause everything is glowing
Skirt so short her ass is showing
And she's looking so youre knowing
You could get it tonight
But theres so much around
Best take your time, do it right

As you keep getting higher
Lights look like they're on fire
Soon all thats left of you
Is your most primal desires
Ass clappin', dick suckin', lock the door to the bathroom – quick fuckin'
Find a whore and it could happen
But it's nothin', cause you're drunk and you'll be blackin' out
Before you even get a chance to think 'bout what you're doing

I want it, I need it, need it to make me feel heated
Shake it, can't take it, must break it
Break if off, yeah, what'd I say bitch?

In the groove that has the whole party movin'
You're cruisin', you don't know what you're doing and you don't give a-
Cause you're so liquored up, you throw it up
And keep on riding cause your timing is on
And that fine one is on you, it's time to get gone
Too far up in it to yawn, till it's finished come on
Get more twisted and bomb the dance floor till it breaks
Start to pondering rape
Me, I'm all about the face
But it takes all kinds
So pay no mind to the taste
Want to hear that song?
You know, the one with the bass
That makes their asses gyrate
Forget to hydrate
Till they're so fucked up they take
Off all of their clothes and whip
It on me like my body's made to fit 'tween their lips
You got the ones on their grill
Or between their hips
But either way, I must say
I really don't give a shit
Long as it's done well, and they promise not to tell
We could do this like an orgy
In the bowels of hell
Where every Lucys hella horny
And their pussies don't smell
Argh...
Where's it at?

I want it, I need it, need it to make me feel heated
Shake it, can't take it, must break it

Responsibility's cool, but theres more things in life
Like getting your dick
Rode all fucking night
By the kind of girl that knows how to keep her shit tight
Legs in the air, looking like they feel nice
Volcano pussy melt your peter like ice
And the drugs got you going back for more cause you're like
I just can't get enough of that cum clutch, well alright
It's time to find one and take one
Right now
It's time to find one and make one say
I'm down""
Think I just found one, 'bout to break one off
Meanwhile

Hallucinating crazy, getting lost for miles
May have gotten too fucked up cause I forgot how to smile
Gonna have to do this shit Jim Morrison style
Will it work? Probably not, but it's worth a try

First hot one I see with sex in her eyes
Will be the hot one I need to take home with me tonight
Wish me luck, give me dap
And I'll talk to you later
And when I do, let's hope my story isnt all about haters
Where's it at? Cause I want it like, man
Got the drugs but need a hot one that'll make me go damn
Was the most banging guts that I ever have smashed
If you got it push it up on me cause I'm feeling that ass, know what I mean?

Bleed it on the drop of a dime, down to pound it 'til it shines
Moonlit lake of blood red wine, make no mistake, I makes it mine
Break shit down and make it grind to the groove used to align
The cascading shades of jaded blues with these rhymes
Nuclear steeze creeps and winds
Through secrets behind and between every time I scream
Shit is mine, it's all mine
All the time, shit is mine

Trips to where few have been
Out of thin air, upon high winds
Rites begin when the sun descends
Have felt what few will ever know
Have seen the truth beneath the glow
Of the ebb and flow, where the roots of all mysteries grow
I am below, so far below the bottom line
Transmitting live, transmissions rise
From the depths out of controlled by
Suspended glance of an unblinking eyes
Imminent gaze cast 'pon the path that winds
'Pon the path I find, and claim as mine
To ride the waves of unrest
Made to make me shine as a testament
To why the ways of the blind will never get
Shit but shanked by my disrespect
Dismiss this life, worship death
Cold blood night of serpent's breath
Exhaled like spells from the endlessness
In the bottomless wells of emptiness
Channeled to invoke what we represent
Secret order, elitist horde of creeping fire, seizing power
Riders of the lupus hour
Eye on palm, time is gone
Moonlight drawn, fly till dawn
Sacrifice to rise beyond
Deep inside the violent calm of the coming storm

Curve like psychotropic scythes
And smell of torn flesh bled dry
By hell swarms of pestis flies
Vomiting forth flames lit by
An older than ancient force
That slays this life with no remorse
The spiral storm of flames inside
The torch I raise, the force I ride
Feel my vessel go up in flames
Flesh torch lit by the unnamed
Direct connection to the source
Vestment of unnatural force
Forever burning black torch
Wisdom of the old and true
Possessed by the chosen few
Shining to reveal the ways
Of a darkness that pervades
All that is and ever was
Inferno of witches' blood
Worship is not on bended knee
Nature knows not of mercy
To pray is to accept defeat
Power pisses on the weak
Bow and beheaded by the beast
Beggar on a bitch's leash
Scum is desperate for relief
Worship is the way I ride
Witching currents through the eye
Of storms that force the false to die
Worship the flames with which I rise into apocalyptic skies
Harsh winds flay mine flesh to bone
In splintered skeleton I roam
Wastelands with naught to call my own
But the path I walk alone
The hunger burns within my gut
As my bones turn into dust
And I know soon come my time
For in mine void a pale horse burns
But I fear not the time I'm taken

All praise due to the fact that we've forgotten how to sweat it
Check it, bring it, kill it
On everything I own, swear would rather slit my throat
And die on the run than be the one who ends up hangin' from that rope
Tied to the thumb of the man who comes to empty your pockets when you choke
Got to get that shit myself and get the fuck out of this game before
I end up getting stuck with no one but myself to blame, all the way insane
Staring at the ceiling, in the dark
Trying not to let the feeling, tear you apart
But the silence is buzzing, and it won't stop
Tell yourself it's almost over, but it's not"

Get it
Get it
Known for it
Get it
Get it
Known for it

Known for it, been through it
Done everything I can to it
Road to it, till I broke through it
Never was attached to it
Took all I had in a flash knew it was 'bout to crash
So I mashed through hit
Known for it
Had to do it
Hacked into it

I pay the price to roll with it
Waste your life and you won't get it
Played out with nowhere to go, bet it
Makes you feel like a ho, dont it?
Dont it?
Known for it
I pay the price to roll with it
Waste your life and you won't get it
Played out with nowhere to go, bet it
Makes you feel like a ho, dont it?
Dont it?
Known for it

Let it eat shit and die
As I creep lit
Off the deep hits with a sick mind
On the secrets I rely 'pon to freak this
Get it)

You can tell me what you said, go ahead
But no sooner than you said it
You can bet it was left for dead
All you said in and out of my head in seconds
Keep 'em guessin' endlessly
Never let 'em know where you're headed
King of the unknown cloaked in mystery
How to show 'em they dont mean shit to me
Put 'em in their place, 'cause they ought to be
Kept in the dark, not 'posed to see never, but only so much of me
Double OG. with a skeleton key
Never meant a thing to me
Effortlessly dead to me
Check the sign no vacancy
Extremely selective memory
Known for it, gotta stay deep in the zone
Or itll take everything that you own, floor it

Known for it

Known for it since way back, all about it
Never been without it
How to ride it inside out of the clouded
By the enemy surrounded
Thoughts that make you feel lost, dont doubt it
You might just need it
Already did that
Can't never go back
Yeah, fuck that
Gets the bozack
Laid on the gas, leaned back and blew it
Twelve gauge blasted out, abused it
Left it for the next, hit eject done wit that
You want it you can have it, no questions asked
Left that shit on the side of the road in a ditch, dont trip
If you have one let a man know so I could flip a bitch and kill it
Get it)
Head for the hills when it makes you feel
Like you can't ever chill no more, fuck it
Every time I get it to wind, 'round my finger and recline
Behave or be slayed cause I will be damned if mine ever decays
Forever on attack, gut check the blind, get it
Game recognize game is tight
Bow down or get banged for life
'Cause I am known for it
I pay the price to roll with it
Waste your life and you won't get it
Played out with nowhere to go, bet it
