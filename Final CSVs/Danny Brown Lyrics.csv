Check

Colder than them grits they fed slaves
Me to rap is like water to raves
AKs with bayonets on deck, rep my set
Sorta like Squidward and his clarinet
I'm in ya bitch mouth, but she fantasizing
Staring at the skinnies, said it's so tantalizing
Dog, I'm strategizing, plotting on the throne
Master of the ace, sitting on chrome
Dark nights tryna sleep, stomach on fire
Delusional from hunger, so I couldn't get tired
Imagining the equalizer goin' from green to red
Words that rhyme together just appear all in my head
And I'm sorta like Neo with the Matrix code
Try to escape it, hoping the drugs'll numb my soul
Say I'm getting old, time's running out
Repeating instrumentals, tryna figure patterns out
I never leave the house, ain't slept in three days
Poppin' pills, writin', drinkin' and smokin' haze
Weavin' kicks and snares, tryna dodge these hooks
Keepin' it original, something that's overlooked
The way a nigga goin', might go out like Sam Cooke
Or locked up, callin' home for money on my books
'Cause if this shit don't work, nigga, I failed at life
Turning to these drugs, now these drugs turned my life
And it's the downward spiral, got me suicidal
But too scared to do it, so these pills'll be the rifle
Surpassing all my idols, took the wrong turn
But can't go back now, so let that blunt burn
'Cause now it's my turn if I fuck it all up
It took a while to get here, now I depend on these drugs, uh
I took a while to get here, now I depend on these drugs

Really Doe,Danny Brown,Atrocity Exhibition,"{'year': 2016, 'month': 9, 'day': 18}","You niggas dont even know
All that talk then no show
Cannot tell me nothin'
Show me somethin' I ain't seen before
That hoe want my piccolo
Smoking on that mistletoe
Make her kiss all on it
While we chop chop on them s
She look like a centerfold
Mouth all on my genitals
Suckin' on it like she gettin' vitamins and minerals
I be on the chemicals, she be on my testicles
Poke her with my tentacle then put her out my schedules
Rolling up them vegetables
Rapping with that special flow
Only way you're next to blow if you be strapped with C
I be fresh from head to toe, every day a fashion show
Used to tote that Calico and serve like John McEnroe
Now I sell out all my shows
Used to sell out all my blow
That was back when we was coppin' dubs to try and roll up 
Now a nigga livin' good
I done made it out the hood
Think I'm goin' back?
I wish a motherfucker would

Yeah, they say I got the city on fire
I ain't boomin', that's a goddamn lie, woah
Really doe, like really doe
Really doe, like really doe
They say I got the city on fire
I ain't boomin', that's a goddamn lie, woah
Really doe, like really doe
Really doe, like really doe
Still wicked as Aleister, Crowley niggas know me well
For heaven's sake, I'm the GOAT, you haters can go to hell
When you're getting money, nigga, every day is sunny
I'ma act an ass on that donkey, let her pull my ponytail
Second grade, took my mama weddin' ring, took that bitch
To showandtell, now I'm married to the game to no avail
Grounded me for like a month, now I'm gettin' high as fuck
Employer tryna write me up, but now I'm a writer
With ambitions of a rider, and half the shit on my rider I don't even want, the Fanta's for us, the Henny's for the sluts chyeah)
Givenchy bikers with the rev rips
Balmain badmon, Bathing Ape on my dick
Paid by the Bloods, raised by the Crips
Soulo Ho the prophecies, atrocities, exhibition
Oh yeah, now a nigga livin' good
But good could be better I wish a motherfucker would
Yeah, they say I got the city on fire
I ain't boomin', that's a goddamn lie, woah
Really doe, like really doe
Really doe, like really doe
They say I got the city on fire
I ain't boomin', that's a goddamn lie, woah
Really doe, like really doe
Really doe, like really doe

Life is like an appetite of truth and dare, I double dare ya
Life to end in vain before the end is near
See I can hear you crying
Silence sittin' in the dark
Holdin' crosses 'cross your heart
Sin is such a work of art
Watch out for the love lost
Bet a thousand, shoot a thousand
Things a nigga do for thousands
Made a million counting sheep
Gave it all to public housin'
Taking off to Abu Dhabi
Beamin' up the motor, Scotty
Talking to promoters, Scotty
Everybody know it's Gotti
Murder one, you've heard of them
The rev undid, the all day madness
Got it off the wipe it off, the evidence, the blood on mattress
Big power, big stages
My zoo cannot fit the cages
This booth is not used to fakin'
My crew just love confrontation
I chewed the face off the laces
I moved the weight from the waitress
I chef the pot that made poison
I cooked then kicked all the patients
My bitch is way beyond basic
That's life insurance, car insurance, good pussy insurance
Ayy, look what we're enduring
Ayy, ridin' in foreigns
Ayy, KDot, four years, I got the same watch
But it's the real watch and that bitch fire
Speed Racer waitin' outside
The roof on it like a tank top
Countin' money, watchin' paint dry
When I'm done is when the rain stops, uh
They say I got the city on fire
I ain't boomin', that's a goddamn lie, woah
Really doe, like really doe
Really doe, like really doe
They say I got the city on fire
I ain't boomin', that's a goddamn lie, woah
Really doe, like really doe
Really doe, like really doe
Good, hood
I wish you motherfuckin' would
Listen, wish a motherfucker would, Brown
I had to put my foot down
It's like I'm popping a clutch
Your hate palpable, your jaw full of dust
You gon' keep talkin' or are we lockin' it up?
And I'm the type of nigga it ain't never been an honor to judge
You a mouse that the falcon picked up
So disrespect will get you checked like the top of the month
I was a liar as a kid so now I'm honest as fuck
And I never pass my mama no blunt
And kept my head straight
Listen deadweight never been a problem to dunk
Look, I just broke up with my bitch cause we ain't argue enough
I keep it dirty as a spliff my uncle Alchemist puff
I strike a birdie on 'em, while I hit your mouth with the club
I wake up early on 'em, gettin' out the house is a must
It's like a sweaty pit, sweaty sick, countin' your dubs
Either that or you gon' catch me on a mountain with monks
Loungin', ask your girl why her mouth on my nuts
You've been the same motherfucker since 
Well it's the lefthanded shooter, Kyle Lowry the pump
I'm at your house like, Why you got your couch on my Chucks?""

Ain’t It Funny,Danny Brown,Atrocity Exhibition,"{'year': 2016, 'month': 9, 'day': 27}","Verbal couture, parkour with the metaphors
The flow house of horror, dead bolted with metal doors
Grinch bitch, six sense with a nose drip
Mind skydive, sniffing bumps in the cockpit
Locksmith of hiphop, appraisal the wrist watch
The rocks 'bout the size as the teeth in Chris Rock's mouth
Sock out the mic, prototype for Adderall
Your work killing fiends 'cause you cut it with fentanyl
So much coke just to sniff, need a ski lift
Flip your table over if you cut it with the bullshit
Nosebleed on red carpets, but it just blend in
Snapping pictures feeling my chest being sunk in
Live a fast life, seen many die slowly
Unhappy when they left so I try to seize the moment

Funny how it happens, who ever would imagine?
That joke's on you, but Satan the one laughing

Ain't it funny how it happens? Ain't it?
Ain't it funny how it happens? Ain't it?
Ain't it funny how it happens? Ain't it?

I can sell honey to a bee
In the fall time, make trees, take back they leaves
Octopus in a straight jacket, savage with bad habits
Broke, serving fiends, got rich, became a addict
Ain't it funny how it happens, who would ever would imagine?
Nose running right now, could ya pass me a napkin?
Managed to somehow to have the upper advantage
Panic when the drugs are gone and nobody is answering
Ain't it funny how it happens?
Ain't it, ain't it funny how it happens?
No way to mask it, a lot became has beens
Rolling up that hundred dollar bill till they cash in
Thinks it gone last, going too fast
Man, it's fucked up, ain't it funny how it happens?

Ain't it funny how it happens? Ain't it?
Ain't it funny how it happens? Ain't it?
Ain't it funny how it happens? Ain't it?

Ain't it funny how it happens? Upcoming heavy traffic
Say ya need to slow down 'cause you feel yourself crashing
Staring in the devil face but ya can't stop laughing
Staring in the devil face but ya cant stop laughing
It's a living nightmare, that most of us might share
Inherited in our blood, it's why we stuck in the mud
Cant quit the drug use or the alcohol abuse
Even if I wanted to, tell you what I'm gonna do
Ima wash away my problems with this bottle of Henny
Anxiety got the best of me so I'm popping them Xannies
Might need rehab but to me that shit pussy
Pray for me y'all 'cause I don't know what coming to me
Bought a ball of coke and my nigga on the way
Got three hoes with him and they all tryna play

Aint it funny how it happens? Who ever would imagine?
That joke's on you, but Satan the one laughing

Ain't it funny how it happens? Ain't it?
Ain't it funny how it happens? Ain't it?

Yeah, chump, you better get the fuck out of here
And take your bitches with you, especially UgMug here

The Hybrid, smoking on papaya
That give you niggas bronchitis, what you write is all vagina
What I write is Wall of China, nigga, that's great
Like eighths of Grape Apes gettin' stuffed in my suitcase
Ready to hit the studio and shit all on your mixtape
Nah, literally, shit all on your mixtape
Wipe with the credits, leave stains on the jewel case
In just two takes, dog, the booth'll get souffléd
You're hiding something like a toupée
Truthfully, my friend, touché
You gon' get exposed like an upandcoming model
And to me, your label seems like one of them pageant mamas
So guess who's the little bitch? That's you
You must suck a lot of dick, that's true
I misuse with issues and pistols
Mind racing like Bristol, heart of igloos
My nigga, you ain't been what I been through
And if so, you would take a pencil through your temple
'Cause I done served fiends on they menstrual
Ain't even had pads, stuffed they panties with tissue
Hit the ave 'cause they mouth ain't bleeding
And your style's like fried chicken without seasoning
Nigga, that's bland, fuck you up and your mans
I smack you like a bitch, nigga, that's openhand
Fuck you and your tough talk
When I monopolize, I throw your ass off the boardwalk
Fag, you ain't play sports, but always at the ballpark
Type of nigga rocking Crocs at the fuckin' Walmart
Drunk like Stallworth, riding in a fiend car
Get flicked, guess what? I'm runnin' from this fiend car
I know a nigga dirty and got the hammer
But this kush got me high like Pac bandanna

I'm a smart nigga that do dumb shit
In your baby mama crib, not flushing after I piss
I'm Ferris Bueller with Frank Muellers
You blank shooters on stank hooters
I'm in Aruba sippin' wine cooler
Mindruler, sort of like hypnotism
That's why these white bitches wanna get with him
I smack it, flip it like Mike Bivins
But to me, your flow's like Ronny DeVoe's
My hoes got toes in expensive high heels
Your hoes' toes is fucked, beauty supply sandals
Handle any situation
I smoke blunts to the face to stay motivated
Irritated when I'm not sedated
Fuck her face like I was obligated
And still fuckin' with them freak hoes
Stank pussy smellin' like Cool Ranch Doritos"

On the phone, gossiping, telling homegirls stories

And employed by none other than them fools with the gold
And them bankrolls explode
And your bitch in my target when I shoot my load

In a school hallways on a burnout celly
Leaving out of class early, caught a sale for 
How long will it last?
Never ending race, chasin' cash
One lane going wrong way 'til I crash
Teacher find my sack, going nowhere fast

Tell me what I don't know
Last night homie got killed at the liquor store
Shot my nigga on the way to get a Swisher
Breaking down the weed when the call got received

We was so ambitious
All we really wanted was new Jordans and some bitches
Flashing bankrolls in the club taking pictures
Thinking we was grown men, really lil' niggas
Jumping dope fiends that's owing us for credit
Taking turns catching sales things copacetic
Slice your tomato if you owe us for the lettuce
Running through the sack of D sorta like Jerome Bettis
Naive to the outcome
Cuz hit the block, hit the stash and they found some
Lock us all up for a bag and some pistols
Now we in the county writing letters I miss you

Tell me what I don't know
Hook raid came through kickin' down the front door
Now we facin' judge, got us sitting at the court
Gave us all probation now we smokin' Newports
Tell me what I don't know
Hook raid came through kickin' down the front door

And we was so gung ho
Wet a nigga up like he forgot his poncho
On the block all day chasin' that cilantro
Hook raid kickin' on the front door
Shit is like a cycle
You get out, I go in, this is not the life for us

And all I see is stars and they coming at me sort of like a meteor shower
Said, my forehead's sweaty, my eyelids heavy, feeling like I ain't going make it
Cause inside my head's like a firework show in the th July in Las Vegas
Said, I'm tripping, I'm slipping, feeling like I just can't move
I done took me a couple more pills
Next thing I know, I'm taking off my shoes
Said, I'm on walking on these clouds like marshmallows
Nodding off, smelling like rose petals
Zoning out, twothree, like the fiend in hell fire and angel wings
I'm conscious to that world, connin science 'bout that world
All these drugs up in me, it's a miracle I ain't mirror Kurt
I'm numb like a mortician, going dumb with Oakland bitches
They say you hella boosie, roll a backwood up with them cookies

I'm smoking, back to back, back to back, back to back
It's the blunt after blunt rotation
Now I'm in a kush coma off the OG aroma
And my brain going on vacation

Get fly, my niggas, dope looks
So many numbers in my phone book
I could start a mothafuckin' phone book
Know all the fly bitches gonna look
Like I'm on something, tell 'em roll something
I'm that one nigga bumping Pac
Be like three hoes, that's a foursome
Fuck niggas always want to hold something
Young hot nigga done froze on 'em
Went cold on 'em, beat the golds on 'em
And clothes on 'em, see the hoes on 'em?
Only fear God, never sold on Him
Man, I swear to God, put my soul on Him
Life's a bitch, but she chose on him
Should've died in Hell, but I rose on 'em
In big shades, fuck the hypocrites, stop
Time let the tats, for the tick, tock
Clocks on the wall, fuck your wristwatch
Pause, let it stop, hope we get by
Bye when I zoom, let it vroom
'bout a hundred goons with a fume, better let it fuse
A hundred miles an hour on the booth, finna let it loose
A hundred by the sour, molly, flower, and they love the shrooms
That's real rap, I'm stating facts
Contradictions, can't take it back
Lil mommy's stripping, make it clap

Nuggets the size of Rakim rings, got my head looking like a fatality screen
Got my mind dripping, gotta get away from all this bullshit in my way
Knowing goddamn well when the high go away
Same shit gon' be still in my way
I'm a slave to the sticky icky, so nigga roll something with me
Been smoking blunts since high school
Now look at all the bullshit I been through
Wanna pass out, but we stayin up, nigga gotta keep one eye open
Cause nigga ain't tryna miss the next turn
Nigga roll up, then we starting smoking
I'm smoking on that ocho, got my mind on that cosmos
Sipping on that purple, got a nigga in slomo
Dipping in that molly, feel like I'm doing  on a Harley
Tell your baby momma sorry, that was one night and please don't call me

Think Im hearing voices
Paranoid and think Im seeing ghostes, oh shit
Phone keep ringing but I cut that shit off
Only time I use it when I tell the dealer drop it off
Had a threesome last night, aint matter what it cost
Couldnt it get hard, tried to stuff it in soft
Had to fuck em both raw, keep my fingers crossed
Been grinding on my teeth so long it's swelling up my jaw
Nothing on but my bathrobe and pinky ring
Your worst nightmare for me is a normal dream
And if I learned anything
Is dont nod off with ya motherfucking cigarette burning
Knocking on my door but I wont answer
Residue on mirrors, Jojo dancer

Been high this whole time, dont realize what I done
Cause when Im all alone, feel like no one care
Isolate myself and dont go nowhere
Smoking blunt after blunt, 'til my eyes start burning
Hennessy straight got my chest like a furnace
Drowning frustrations in a ocean of sin
Thinking irrational, I have no emotions
Cold cold world, some might say
Freezing on the snow, brain feel a bit frostbit
Nauseous, dont know the last time I ate
But I eat these fucking rappers like fucking last steak
On death row, feel like I am
You never know, one day you're here, the next you're gone
So I put it all up in these songs...

Have no apprentice, style uninherited
Laughing at you peasants 'cause my penmanship is excellence
Whenever in the presence, eyes get wide

Just release me

Feeling like I got money
Know I'm just nigga rich
Even if she fuck me
I still know life a bitch
Bought a nightmare, sold a dream
Happiness went upstream
Blame myself, I had no control
Now I'm living with no soul
I'm on a road that never ends
Don't know opposite of sin
Some people say I think too much
I don't think they think enough
Time rough but it got rougher
Weight heavier up on my shoulders
Living crooked 'til it's over
Can't be straight, can't be sober
Thought process so immature
Can't make it up, up out the sewer
Feeling like there's no hope
Blaze dope, my mind float

Love ain't enough with no bucks

Leave my body, soul go afloat
On a roll that never ends
Don't know where I should begin
Feeling trapped, no looking back
Head first in that deep end

When I die, I leave alone
Getting high, I feel low
But we all know life goes on

Sleep with the beast, Daniel in the lion's den
Still drop dirty, have to pop a Niacin
Itched all damn day, just to get violated
Ever seen a roach with babies have babies?
In the hood like whatever, we in this bitch together
Once got a ho, ain't had money for the room
So we did the humpty hump in a Burger King bathroom
Lowkey kept it undercover
The way she slurp slurp, she's the quicker picker upper
No job, dropped out and a felon
On the net, met a fat white bitch named Helen
 pounds, maybe more like 
Had a couple babies,  give or take it
Call that securin' the bag, had to fight the baby dad
Try to stop how I eat so I got up on his ass

What's in the dark, always come to light
Head was nasty, you'd think she had head lice
Why try? Throw bleach in your eye
Put your life on the line, hang 'em out to dry
Tryna keep my hands clean, out here ridin' dirty
Shit get messy? Mop him up with the .
High Tide, Gain off the Arm and Hammer
Swim towards the current, system try to drown me
Stain your record like Clorox 'n' darks
Spin cycle had four tops for one
Out the slums, nobody gave me nothin'
Had temptations, so I hustled, David Ruffin
Papa was a rolling stone, so I sold rocks to 'em
Beam up Scotty, we got liftoff Houston
Left my sack in my clothes, Mama just did a load
Eight ball in my jeans, fiends say it taste like soap

Twenty five a peep show when I enter the booth
Mop the floor when I leave, might slip if you do
Cover your ears of your kids, we got round two
Fuck a bitch two times, call it deja vu
Fuck a stripper for some change, actual change
Dime, penny, nickels, actual change
Okay, wanna hear the story? Left the house in a hurry
I was at Hunky Dory's, got some dances from Lori
Left my wallet at home, ain't wanna hear that story
In the car had change from laundry
Had to wash clothes anyway, told her, I'm sorry""
Slow anyway, before you was boring
Said, Gimme a moment"", jumped on it and bounced
No fabric softener, 'cause I was hard
Then she gave me head, had me moaning and groaning
Guess who I seen doing laundry next morning?"

Risks I take, you'd swear I had the balls the size of beanbags
Not what you're used to, bitch, I rep the Bruiser
And the label Fools Gold, jeans with medusas
Bitches wanna scoop us, get pussy like loofahs
Y'all niggas losers, cop clothes from them boosters
Hoes wanna choose up, of course they gon' choose us
So though you need a stylist, also you need a tutor
These stupidass niggas wouldn't know what to do
So they copy wack niggas, guess what that makes you?
The game's so trendy, that's why these labels fail
'Cause they don't care about music, just firstweek sales

So they say you need a hit, a charttopping single
That's why it's called commercial, because you need a jingle
A smash club banger, play it all night long
You never get on without a radio song
So this my radio song
This my radio song

She wanna ride the wave, watch me do my swag surf
Party like a rockstar, never bought a makeup purse
Songs with no feelings, but she feel my thing on her
Stripper with a leaky ceiling, I'ma make it rain on her
Taught me how to Dougie, I'd rather see you jerk
Until it's skeetskeet on the walls and her shirt
She'd rather hear a love song about what she getting
But not from Danny Brown, 'cause bitch, I ain't tricking
Do the pretty girl rock, and even though you ugly
Getting dirty money, but bitch, I ain't Puffy
Ice cream paint job, semi with the hemi
Heavyduty Chevy, not a Bimmer, Benz or Bentley
There's no originality, carboncopy singles
He made Black and Yellow""? I'ma make Black and Emo""

Rolling up two at a time, same clothes from yesterday
Had a smoke around a custo, paid his ass a stone
When the narcs came and raided hid on the roof and smoked bong
Fuck with rat bitches, head from them hunnies
Lost a sack but I got back, cause the dice game was hitting
It was me and Carbo, breaking day in the lobby

From last night still drunk
Popped a Adderall nigga that was my lunch
And I gotta hunch
Roll another blunt

Caught up in the whirlwind
Life took a tail spin
Hid behind designer shades
Life of sin
Lost control
Dont have a soul
Myself I dont know no more
Numbing up with drugs
To suppress these feelings
Praying to the heavens
Letting these devils get the best of me
Nigga whats the recipe for a good time
A whole lot of liquor while you doing coke lines
Residue on my mustache
How could it last
Roll a hundred dollar bill
Nigga blow cash

Cant nobody tell me no
Nigga pass me that blow
Got to the point aint gotta buy drugs
Niggas just give to em to me
Yea they think they showing love
And thats whats up
Kinda fucked up
Now I do way it more then I use to
Have no clues
All the false alarms
Where most would've died
But my tolerance strong
Been cursed all along
Whole family addicts
Floating through my bloodstream
Like I gotta have it
Tried to quit a few times
But it didnt work out
Can you understand
What my life is about
Cause I think you dont
So take a step inside
A mind so horrific
Images that I hide
Take look inside
Scare you for life
This is the way
Nigga step inside
Mimosa for breakfast
With a thick hoe from Texas
Got good karma
Feel the persona
Got the Hermes towel while I'm up in the sauna
Smoking on ganja
Tasting like caramel
Ass so fat think she get it from her mama
Came along way hitting thots in spots
Now I fuck pornstars I done jerked off and watched
Spending racks up in  Bergdorf
Bitches take ya shirt off
Took a couple mollys
Now they wanna have a twerk off
Guess who the judge
Why they hold the grudge
Me I done got it on my own out the mud
Will it all last
Will it all last
Roll a hundred dollar bill

Will it all last

You rappers are venereal, and never in my stereo
Might spray your ass with vinegar, the next time that I see ya bro
Bet your ass still won't be tight
The size of my dick, nigga, every pussy tight
I write all night 'til the sun come up
Dodging texts from your sister tryna lick on my nuts
Cobra clutch the game, put that bitch into submission
Your bitch want the stick shift, no transmission
Dawg, I'm on a mission, you're playing exhibition
On an expedition, popping X but never tripping
Chilling with a vixen, tryna stick my dick in
Red head ho, like a young Kathy Griffin
Smoked so many blunts, I can hear my lungs whistling
Still rolling up, ho smelling like chicken
Rap Martin Lawrence, all you other rappers boring
Bruiser make  Live Crew look like some mormons
Nigga my essay is hard like a lifedoing ese
Gangbanging on the yard with a home made machete
Been nice since cassette tapes, stay smoking heavy
Popped a couple pills, eye's glowing like Belly
Used to stash the cracks in the seams of my Pelle
Detroit nigga, but I'm smoking on LA

And is anybody nervous?
I'm red' to go, I said I'm red' to go
I said is anybody worried?
I'm red' to go, I said I'm red' to go
Is anybody scared?
I'm red' to go, I said I'm red' to go
Well, I used to be afraid
I'm red' to go, I said I'm red' to go

Tired of where I came from but know where I'm going
Tears in my eyes, cause I'm smoking on an onion
Aroma on that 'etra, scary and McNairy
Off of moon rocks in Barcelona popping cherries
Blowjobs from model twins, doing drugs with acronyms
So many lines, thought this shit was Busch Gardens
Party starting monster with the hair like Blanka
Hotel room like a hair metal concert
This blonde made the dick do the spray outta Contra
You disrespect I hit you with the slap of Tatanka
For dinner nigga used to eat shit that didn't match
Like cornbeef hash and some fucking Apple Jacks
Used to bag up the packs and eat Coney every night
Bologna all night, traps with no peanut butter
Couldn't waste it on the mice, so I wasted every night
Everything came with rice, and I knew I wasn't right
So I got my ass up, fuck depending on luck
Greyhound to NY 'bout  bucks
Kept my hopes up but my confidence was low
Now my self esteem is astral looking at this cash flow
Did it my way, I ain't nobody ho
I'm 'bout to pimp the rap game, bitch, I'm red' to go

Detroit187,Danny Brown,XXX,"{'year': 2011, 'month': 8, 'day': 15}","The way these bitches on my cock
You'd swear it was  and Teen Wolf just dropped
And my name was Michael J. Fox
But no bitch, it's Danny Brown, I got some weed up in my sock
So bitch, get high with your nigga
The sack I got is lookin' like some green caterpillars
But it's smellin' like a skunk that's ohsodefensive
These bitches suck my dick like it was moral incentive
I'm off the chain like broke nunchucks
From where these little niggas try to shoot you over new Chucks
A little dark like wet nubuck
Describe my state of mind is inside the tomb of King Tut
Murders all the time is all I see
Detroit  on you niggas' TV
And I can first degree this beat, kill a nigga, no charges
Fuck a female MC and a pop artist
Oh, baby, I like it raw
And my dick so big, left stretch marks on her jaw

I'm so institutionalized
I wake up at  AM because I think it's chow line
Borderline porcupine, a step from drinking turpentine
Just to wash down a plate of wack rappers' rhymes
I got a mind in the cosmos
And if these niggas cold, then I guess I'm osmosis
That be blowing on some potent that these white boys be growing
While you niggas smoking something smelling like a tanning lotion
Concoctions, make worldending potions
These other niggas got lines, dog, I got encroachments
I get endorsements, so motherfuck your cosigns
Punch punchlines, I'll punch rappers 'til your broke spine
'Member back in ', told 'em it was showtime
Now they pull they cam'phones out when I go for mine
Light, camera, action, Hybrid be snapping
'Cause the days of no tissue, had to wipe with wet napkins
Smear up the classified, know it sound trife
But to be honest, a metaphor for my life
Stop

Buzzing off the barbiturates and amphetamines
Chased it with a forty ounce of Ready Clean
I swear I never ever smoked a better weed
Your bitch said I'm the swaggiest nigga she ever seen
Run up in your crib, two K's, one mag
Your girl get snatched like Cool J in I'm Bad""
Cost to live, you ain't made enough
Guarantee bullet holes with a laser touch
European garments drape my body if I ain't hipstered up
If she smile with eye contact, then the bitch'll fuck
Homie gon' make me send them killers after him
Them niggas swing swords like World Fence Champions
You was popping pills and drinking liquor
Now you thinking you a gangster killer
I leave you stankin', nigga
Laid down facedown like you takin' a planking picture
But I can keep the shots in the weapon
Put the bat to back of your leg
Grab your chin and the back of your head
And twist them shits in opposite directions"

Before your ass can answer, get your whole shit bust, nigga
Done rose out them ashes, drinking Fiji water
Wanna pull me in that fire while I'm tryna feed my daughter
Wanna snatch my momma's plate, and tell her she can't eat
Then we gon' have us some discrepancies right here in this street
Because the weak don't speak, get left in silence
And when you don't listen, gotta speak with violence
And duct tape the grandmomma, strip a man of all his honor
Tryna be a G, now you wish you a goner
I walk with the Gods with a tongue for the devil
Tryna keep a nigga thirsty, so for rain, I pray mercy

The return of the gangster, 'cause niggas don't believe
I roll hotter than my sleeve, leave a nigga in the street

Want that old Danny Brown, but nigga, I'm like, Chill""
The return of the gangster, fuck a hipster, squeeze a trigger

ES to the GN
Eastside niggas keep roaches in the ashtray
Twenty thousand out the public housing on a bad day
Drop it in the pot, if it ain't locking, that's some bad yay'
Tryna save my soul, I wish the Lord would meet me halfway
Devil on my shoulder as I'm whipping up this yola
And that motor hit the rotor, ship this blow to Minnesota
Only option is a shootout if the police pull me over
This shit get realer than shit that's on your PlayStation controller
Call of Duty ass nigga, dickinthebootyass nigga
Don't pour or roll no dough up, then I don't get no cash with you
Feel like, Fuck the world,"" it ain't no friends up in this business
Fuck my label, show them I'm the real realest nigga in it

At glass tables, on her knees sniffin' coke
Tell her get a hold, grip on life
Rather fill her cup up, liquor with no ice
Twice had an abortion, young, dumb and scorchin'
Rate that she goin', she might be whorin'
Signs she ignorin', but doesn't recognize
Blind to what's occurrin', what's goin' in your mind?
Seven days a week, same shit every morning
Callin' her a cab from different niggas' apartments
Wantin' her to change, but she won't, dog

Lost in the fog, head in the smoke
Laughin' at the world 'cause her life is a joke

When I look, I cannot see reflection in the mirror
I broke bread with the Judas and I think I see it clearer
These niggas want what's mine, but I'll be damned if I'ma give up
Stuck up in the hood, praying rap would get me out
Mama 'bout to lose her house, gotta figure this shit out
Used to catch the bus to th just to hustle for some Prada
In the kitchen with my uncle, beat the pot like a piñata
Baraka with the product, used to hide it in my closet
Type of shit that have a fiend crawling on his carpet
Walking over carcasses of artists in my garden
Nice with the bars, even the beat begs my pardon
Got me mistaken, Muslim salami bacon
Always on the defense, so it's no offense taken
I'm smokin' on them raisins from the bay, they taste amazing
Cajun, kicking flavor all the time, not on occasion
Would be amazed, all the time, I heard I wouldn't make it
I was writing shit that was so damn amazing
When half these little niggas was still watching That's So Raven
I was out there hustling, scrapin' up and saving
Just to catch a twelve hour bus to NY
Sleepin' on the floor in studios, asking God, Why?""
But never got deterred from the voice I heard inside
Tell myself every day the greatest that's alive

And I'ma give 'em hell for it
Until it's heaven on earth, my nigga, I'ma give 'em hell for it
For whatever it's worth, my nigga, I'ma give 'em hell for it
Unless death come first, my nigga, I'ma give 'em hell for it
For whatever it's worth, my nigga, I'ma give 'em hell

'Cause we living in that
Actavis double cups, was addicted to that
Had them demons on my back, was escaping through that
Blamed everybody but myself, apologies for that
So they hold a nigga back for the way that I act
People scared of doing business, thinkin' I smoke crack
I react immature to anyone talkin' smack
'Cause where I'm from, respect the only thing that you have
Grew up virtually poor, realities unmasked
So my task is inspire your future with my past
I lived through that shit, so you don't have to go through it
Stepping stones in my life, hot coals, walk with me
Listen when I speak, every time, talk with me
Couple screws loose, you don't wanna start with me
Got it from Motown, feel David Ruffin pain
Wanna cry right now, so I'm wishing that it rain
'Cause I'm knowing I'm the best, they compare skills to sales
Tell myself everyday, know this shit ain't real
Radio don't make you ill, get a hit, they feel they self
Respect for lyricism in this game, ain't none left
Have a bitch like Iggy think she sicker than me
And that's so fucked up, that's just how this shit be
I just wanna make music, fuck bein' a celebrity
'Cause these songs that I write leave behind my legacy
And I'ma give 'em hell for it
Until it's heaven on earth, my nigga, I'ma give 'em hell for it
For whatever it's worth, my nigga, I'ma give 'em hell for it

Break the dank in that swizzle, riding 'round in a dope fiend rental
Pulling up on ya baby momma, like bitch what you tryna get into?
If you ain't about that sucking, then ho you can keep on trucking

Fool's Gold the clique, and musically we don't fuck with you

Coulda rhymed ASCAP with ass capped, Jadakiss already said that

Broke as fuck and no bitch will fuck, in my basement, jerking off lonely
Used to fall off fucking with the work, but guess what I'm back on ho
No more messing on that couch, now I'm all the way in your bitch mouth
And I gag her 'til she cry, on her stomach fluid come up
I be fucking her face on the daily, you be kissing that bitch in the mouth

Like open wide, ho!
Open wide, ho!
Open wide, ho!
Just open wide, ho!

If I tell a bitch to do a flip in the air
Then land on my dick from the back
Look I ain't tripping, no, I ain't kidding
Have her licking my head like a cat
Now shut up bitch and get the Amber Rose
Come and let a young real nigga cut
But nah, bitch, this dick ain't free
So she copped my dick and then cuffed
Now come here chick and let me feed you nuts
Cum on her ass and have a lioness
How her mouth can be wide as her legs
My dick is long as the Brooklyn bridge
Hit it raw cause I'm with the shit
Gave her the pipe, said she need a fix
Gave you life, you can't believe the sight
Take the wood like a termite
Made a crash up at the turnpike
But it's a rental, I'll get another
Wonder if you got the gift from your mother
I used to play hoops with your brother
Even played a lil' house with your sister
She always call me daddy or mister mister
Why the  can do more than fist her
Too busy getting head, I ain't never kissed her
Beat the cheeks, I never missed a beat
I was screwed up on the couch so I skeet skeet
Ho can make an orgasm last a week
I'mma get her deep, she a masterpiece
Hell nah I don't love that bitch
Hell yeah, I'm gon' enjoy that bitch
But I hope my daughter don't be like this
But I know her momma know that shit exist

Backwood of that good to the pain for the brain
A cup of lean for me to sleep, see I be going through thangs
Music business got me stressed Xanax to maintain
Waking up on wrong sides got me writing in vain
Vicodin to numb me up help me cope with the struggle
Remember praying to get in there saying rap to my brothers
And now I, got the whole world listening
Give your ear for a second a life changing decision
Every other minute thoughts run through my mind
'bout how bad I wanted this but I cannot waste time
So I'm trapped in the beat, stuck on every line
Nothing else matters, except my next rhyme
You can never understand all the pressure I'm against
Getting high thinking how to make it better than your last shit

Might have a mental breakdown
If it wasn't for these pills here now
And no matter how it gets I hold on
Rolling up this dope to cope I float on, nigga I float on
Let's go, hop up in the Chevy fourdoor
Let's roll I float on)

Remember back when mommy sent me for the Wonder Bread
And niggas jumped me stomped on my fucking head
It's like I learned right then you either sink or you swim
And to beat your enemy, you gotta think like them
So I was up late breaking day with the gremlins
Music in my heart but my thoughts wouldn't listen
Hood outta byebye cause rap shit was scifi
So I'm tormented with the things I seen with these eyes
Can't get a wink 'less I'm leaning off of syrup
Dreaming of my past like a nightmare so I wake up
Staring at the ceiling with this feeling that won't go away
Until the verse is done wrote all day but them shit's throwaway
So I'm breaking day sniffing Adderall writing
And not for the money for the life after dying
Pray I get old just to hear I been the future
Just to see my influence in this genre of music

And might make it to see somehow
If it wasn't for these pills here now
And no matter how it gets I hold on
Rolling up this dope to cope I float on, nigga I float on

Everybody thirsty, and they looking for a refill
If the gang eating, guns barking at your doggy bag
Get took out for your take out now you carry out
Murder by delivery, married at the Paramount
I just coughed up a fair amount of niggas might air it out
Judge a book by cover, so we never educated
It ain't about races, poor and rich segregated
Just to get the bacon, dog, you gotta go HAM
Use to be lost until I found who I am
But it took the hook to eat the palm on my hands
Locked, tryna get real creative with some Spam
Glock tend to jam cause a nigga serve butter
Just to get a little bread had to keep the mayo smothered

But no one ever thought that I would take it past local
High like 'top a totem, man, somebody shoulda told 'em
That if money grow on trees, being rich is dime a dozen

So I'm smoking by my lonely
By my goddamn selfI don't need your help, homie
'Cause don't nobody really know me

Radiohead shit: Fiends with the bends
Back when Granny used to tell me Stay Out of In""
Letting the cold air out, tryna know my whereabouts
Gone for three days, ain't nobody ever heard about—
How I got them Jordans, but that ain't too important
When I got a bitch pregnant, and I'm stacking for abortion
And all I really wanted was to give myself a portion
Lit up off the Henny, got a nigga selfabsorbing
Smoking on a bogey, no bustdown, who can I trust now?
A lady snitchin', got the whole block down
Now, we gon' eat now
No rebound when you're boxedout, belly of the beast now
Now, you got me feeling trapped, and I can't look back
When the road ahead is gold and the past is made of ash
And I'm going through the trash, tryna find a little treasure
Living for the better, tryna get myself together

Told myself back then when I used to ride a Schwinn
Now I'm on a tour bus going places I ain't never been
Wrote my rhymes down on a paper bag
That was way back
Having dreams of a Cadillac
Dog, I had to bounce back
Locked a nigga up, why they do me like that?
Now I'm on the jack in the county asking mommy for some money
Swear to God she'd do anything for me
Now we out the hood and the nightmare is us going back
So I won't go to sleep 'til I finish that

Miss a minute, second, hour
Living on borrowed time, can't think about tomorrow

What it takes if you want anything
Got me missing sleep 'cause my mind on the beat
So while I'm counting bars, y'all be counting sheep
No cheat sheet, get it out the mud
Get it how you live, why I'm out here in the field
My nigga, wake up, wipe the cold out your eyes
It's a cold, cold world, but even hotter when you die
So no try to do, what about you?
Work hard for where I'm at, do the same thing too
A lot locked up wishing they was like you
Got a letter from my nigga saying he be out in June
Been down for a minute and every since sentence
Things ain't been the same, so I'm missing my nigga

Was trapped in the storm, but I made it out the rain

Clean Up,Danny Brown,Old ,"{'year': 2013, 'month': 9, 'day': 30}","I start to wonder
Why time moves so slow
No matter how much I implore

The thoughts are cloudy
In the marijuana sky, but it started raining molly
It got me feeling sorry while I'm feeling on myself
Cause I don't know this bitch name but I'm feeling on her breast
I know it ain't right, but in this state I don't care
A whole week went past, I ain't gone nowhere
Hotel rooms crushing pills and menus
Daughter sending me messages saying Daddy, I miss you""
But in this condition I don't think she need to see me
Ain't slept in four days, and I'm smelling like seaweed
Problems in my past haunt my future and the present
Escaping from reality got me missing my blessings
Sent a couple G's but that make it no better
And now I got habits that ain't getting no better
And it ain't that easy tryna get all together
Been stressed for so long, think depression done set in

It's time for me to clean it up
I came too far to fuck it up, like

Pops left mom when I was only 
So rightfully that meant I had to be the man of things
And by , mom was damn near homeless
And now I'm , she 'bout to fucking cop her own shit
Triple beam dreams brought me nothing but nightmares
Thought that I was helping but the system don't fight fair
Cases had me locked up, mama always wrote me
Pops my only visit, they the only ones that loved me
That's why I feel bad, popping Givenchy tags
Knowing that this tee could feed my nephew for a week
For material I'm weak, acting like I don't care
I spend it all on clothes, then something is wrong there
I sent my mom some G's, but that makes it no better
Cause now I got habits that ain't getting no better
And it ain't that easy tryna get it all together
I been stressed for so long, think depression done set in

It's time for me to clean it up
I came too far to fuck it up, like"

And you're on the podium with speech of rhodium
Your bitch like a leech on my scrotum
Ho tried to kill the dick, strangled them and choked 'em
After she was done I looked down at my penis
Like, she really ain't mean it

I take a piss in that same sink you wash dishes with
You're illiterate, ya Bisquick soft

Psycho, crazy, deranged
Spittin' on tracks like oncoming train
Vocal laid down like tower of burnin' flame
Sippin' gasoline, made her pour canteen
Stone Temple Pilot crashed in to the wall
While listenin' to WuTang and rubbin' on his balls
Off them bars of footballs, thoughts playin' foosball
In VIP, sleep with shades on the booya
So bitch, bust that shit open like you landed kneefirst
Let me stick my finger in it, what it smell like, birth?
If it smell like syrup you gon' get this work
But if it smell like perch, gotta disperse
I'm a pervert wearin' sherbet, take your baby mama, turn her
As a youngin' mama should have handcuffed me to the furnace

I used to play with pistols in crackhouses
Skippin' school just to fuck bitches on dirty couches, abandoned houses

Passin' 'round forties, brown paper bags
Rolling up a Swisher while this rat freak a Black
It ain't about nothing, but let me hold something
Ate a Lunchable for dinner, nigga, I ain't fronting
Caught the bus to Eastland just to walk around it
Ain't buy nothing, nigga, just walked around it
Looked at some hoes, I ain't even holler

Change Up,Danny Brown,uknowhatimsayin¿,"{'year': 2019, 'month': 10, 'day': 4}","They thought I was gone, back from the grave
Mind of a master, blood of a slave
Heart of a king, stuck in between
The devil and an angel on my shoulder when I speak
Lost in the streets, found on the beat
Still kept a clip, asked, and got it for cheap
Now I'm in the world where they pray for the weak
Standup niggas take shots to the knees
Lord, have mercy, pray for me
Need to calm down, so pass me the weed
Got me stressed out, situations look bleak
Time's runnin' out, how'd my days turn to weeks?

Up all night, toss and turn when I sleep
Pacing around, drowning sorrows in my drink
Can't even think, got my mind wrapped up
But I still bite down, clench my teeth, knuckle up

I'ma keep goin', you cannot blame us
Never look back, I would never change up
Never look back, I would never change up
Never look back, I would never change up
I'ma keep goin', you cannot blame us
Never look back, I would never change up
Never look back, I would never change up
Never look back, I would never

Every other day, always some shit
I'm the underdog but I'm never over it
Gotta keep a grip when the rent due
Niggas tryna get you for every last cent
Ain't no pretend, ain't tryna make amends
Just tryna keep my legacy, I'm legend in the end
So never try the scene, 'cause you could get bent
'Cause I protect mine from beginning to the end
Lord, have mercy, pray for me
Distanced from my friends, enemies close to me
Gotta stay at work, things change in a blink
Gotta stay woke, they all in a deep sleep

Up all night, toss and turn when I sleep
Pacing around, drowning sorrows in my drink
Can't even think, got my mind wrapped up
But I still bite down, clench my teeth, knuckle up"

Where the dreadies sit, how did niggas left me out for dry
Feeling envious, cause I draw affection through the slime
Now my belly big, lost a couple bredrins to the grind
I could never quit, I just be adventurous with mines
Need the pennies quick, niggas still invested in the bribe and the friendliness
Only ones to question me was God and the federate

You can never trust yourself when you're livin' a lie
Like a few of these rappers I know, always following trends
Never stick to the code
Back in the day, they sold their soul for Rock'n'Roll
But with this rap shit, a nigga sell his bootyhole
What you doing over there, we doing this over here
My aunt died, was on tour, couldn't shed no tears
Had to go, won't stay, so I'm turning the page
We can wish all we want, but this ain't back in the days
Gotta move on, nigga, leave the past in the past
Never know when it's over cause this life won't last
New nigga in your spot, now he punchin' the clock
Shit getting out of hand, tell me when will it stop
This little pink pill tasting like it got sugar in it
Done so much coke, it's like a gram on my booger, nigga
Shoulda, woulda, coulda, nigga, let her wake up
It's a million ways to get it, better make 'em pay up
Don't stay up, sleep real well
Stopped worrying 'bout you niggas, started caring 'bout myself
Looked in the mirror, started staring at myself
Told myself, I'ma get it, fuck everything else

Like a moth in a flame, when you burn, you learn
Rush to mistakes, but just wait your turn
Get what you need, what you want, you earn
When it's time, then it's time, but that ain't my concern
Like a moth in a flame, when you burn, you learn
Rush to mistakes, just to wait your turn
Get what you need, what you want, you earn

I never had a problem with paying attention
Popped the Adderall, then I wrote a verse in minutes
Play this in your iPod, nodding on Vicodin

Turn your kids to fiends with a drug called Ritalin

Uh... what they did last night
Pills and orange tubes got the government right
They say there's no stopping from starting Oxycontins
They in trailer parks sniffing it with rolled dollars
All about a dollar, baby killers in the world
The ones that supply you, when you gotta fucking cold

I can't feel, when I'm off this pill
No doubt, I done 'em all, Xanny bars, Adderall
My mind drifts, let it dissolve in what I sipped
My soul blowing in the wind, eat pills and Vicodins

They say I, might go out like Heath Ledger
Laughing at the Joker off an antidepressant
And if you can't sleep, they got a pill for that
Brown good in popping Enzyte to get my dick fat
Fags take hormones to grow a set of titties
Got a pill to make your dick hard, when you're 
Now tell me do that add up, G
When they lock your ass up for a dimebag of weed
Teen girls take birth control, killing off the seeds
Got her looking , when she only 
They got illegal ones like X and Mescaline
In my teens my homie took one, he did 
My granny turned out on them blood pressure pills
And if she don't pop 'em, she might not be here
But is it really helping make a nigga shed a tear
I wonder, do they make a pill to take away your fears?

Stacks in the Foamposite, work in the Jansport
Praying for a personal, every time I go to court
Eastland shopping bag, ho's at the food court
Around the time you got your sounds put in that mammoth
I was on Clairmount,  for  slanging
Shining like the silver on a Air Max '
Took this rap shit serious about in '
Got these niggas scared, ask them if I'm lying
Because I shit on niggas bar for bar without trying
Ain't in your top three? Then bitch, you can't count
Only thing that makes sense is dollar amount
Ounce to the face, stank go to waste
You still tryna find a place to record your mixtape
This ain't here for ya
Even Jesus tried to break teeth for dropping vocals"

Toes looking right cause early you got a pedi
You ain't got a man but you got a baby daddy
Go out ya way to get drunk at a party every Saturday
But who am I to judge, baby? Want another drink?
Tonight give me your brain, you ain't gotta think
Just let yourself go, tomorrow blame the alcohol
You ain't got a job, it ain't like you got a class tomorrow
Find you a purse to borrow, beats is like your friends
Start being in thoughts cause the party never ends
ID. say , shop at Forever 
Best friend , she's forever 
Going down the same path, take another sip
Pour another glass, take another hit
I tell you that you're beautiful, your pops never did
Probably why it ain't a pop around for none of your kids
Sorry for putting out ya biz
But right now I can't stop looking at them tits
And grabbing on that ass, filling up the glass
Get you drunk and fuck you, that's a part of my task
And she really helping, being a real sport about it
Full cup of Goose, pinch of cran and she allowed it
 minutes later, man, she really all about it
 minutes later, man, she took a nigga out, kid, drinks on me

Pass the designated driver the keys
And don't worry y'all, drinks on me, so have a toast with me
Bring your ID. hanging with me
It's on my tab y'all, drinks on me, so have a toast with me
Hennessey and Grand Cru for me
I take a sip and say free Max B, so have a drink with me
So don't worry y'all, 'bout no fees
I said I got it y'all, drinks on me, so have a drink with me

Say my auntie sort of like an alcoholic
Been drinking since the teens, shitting blood in the toilet
Started real young, nigga pushed the bottle on her
Drunk, fully clothed in tubs, I cut showers on her
But I still love her and I live life for her
She ask me for a dollar, I'm gon' give it to her
Stay drinking on the brew, keep a can in her hand
Tied grocery bag full of keystone cans
Alcoholism has poisoned our city
Liquor store on every corner ain't like that in other cities
So you have a drink, take a hit and pass that
Give a buck to a wino help him buy crack
Dwell on the past, looking towards tomorrow
Wish I could lend my pain, let you borrow my sorrow
Live where lil' niggas wanna be Chris Partlow
Say fuck the lotto, buck's on a bottle, drinks on me
Pass the designated driver the keys
And don't worry y'all, drinks on me, so have a toast with me
Bring your ID. hanging with me
It's on my tab y'all, drinks on me, so have a toast with me

So I ride ' with nowhere to go
Bag came in, cause I moved the bows
The son of a player no love for hoes
And the year ain't new, but it don't look old
Should hit Northland see what they got new
But I'd rather hit the store go fuck with the crew
Ride around the hood, blow blunt after blunt
Seem like a good day I ain't seen a hook once
So I'm riding in the wood 'bout to pick my man up
Hit a couple corners, probably roll some gan up
My man's got his heater 'cuz the streets is cold
But I told him put it up because my L's is bold

Let's go, c'mon, roll with a nigga
Where we going? I don't know my nigga
Let's blow, hey yo you got another swisher?

Just another day in the streets of the D
Gas on high and my tank on E
These hoes wanna fuck, but they charge you a fee
And the work might cost, but to murder is free
Pray and holler at my man 'cuz he owe me a few
Gan in the air, with a Bud Ice brew
Narco's ride, so I took my sack
And before hop on the lines 'cuz I know its packed
Break bows, so I ride slow, slow
Hit the Coney's cause my gas low, low
Cop a bag, roll a blunt and say to extras
And I swoop a couple hoes then ride up Dexter
Blow my trees, no stress at all
Gan in mine, but it's stress in y'all
Hit the crib get dressed as soon as the sun fall
Right now, I'm just rhyming, timing my phone calls

Now I'm doing shit thought I never could afford
Art on the wall like science project boards
Parquet floor, green like Celtic
Furniture you touch be like whats this velvet?
Used to play the block with the sack by the pelvis
Fiends ODing on they toilet like Elvis

So now I kill beats, so much coroners pick up notepad sheets
Bullhead skinnies Hilfiger fleece, sort of like a futuristic 
A lot my niggas dead, a lot my niggas locked
A lot my niggas left and moved on from the block
Some of my niggas here and some got guap
And some may gotta piss in a mothafuckin' pot
We used to play the block, we never get old
The fridge ain't got shit but the bread with the mold
And some ain't got shoes just the ones with the holes
The one you call talkers with the fucking flapping soles
So now we change the system to shit we can't afford and
Check from Mickey D's can't buy a pair of Jordans
And hot boys gotta get it how they live

Close your eyes, I'm 'bout to take you to a city

Run and hide when you on the other side
It ain't easy, it ain't nowhere to go It ain't nowhere to go)
Land of misery a place full of history
But seriously, it's nowhere to go It's nowhere to go)

I seen my nigga Luck before he went up for life
He said, Brown you nice and nigga send your sacrifice
Chill on the streets, it ain't here for ya
Cause when you get locked, nobody care for ya
Did a little time ain't make a phone call
Book stay thick like a church going broad
Locked in the county ain't never seen a thorough
Now I hit the thrift stores cop a vintage polo
Never talk loud to get my point across
The only alligator that I rock is Lacoste
Detroit player, word to my nigga Big
Play this type of shit while you rocking up for Big
Cause I blow two blunts before I brush my teeth
Ain't seen what they looking like but I'm smoking good
Eating better, so I stay full
J stay paid, Brown do too
Close your eyes, I'm 'bout to take you to a city

I hope I'll find out after the guitar solo

After the guitar solo
The guitar solo
After the guitar solo
The guitar solo

This little girl pregnant man she only 
Bust in by an older nigga, lack of selfesteem
Her mom's a gold digger, and her dad is not around
Last time she saw him he took her to Belle Isle
A child with a child and her momma don't care
Another bridge card gon' put her on welfare
Baby daddy say he got her, prolly won't succeed
Cause he bought a pair of Cardi's 'stead of reingup the weed
His dream is a cutty with some rims on that bitch
Is that the type of man you want raising your kids?
So now you ditch class cause your belly getting bigger
And every other day your momma fuck another nigga
So what she gonna do is find herself a drug dealer
Her dream and goal in life is to be saved by a nigga
And will she get far? I really don't know bro
I hope I find out after the guitar solo

The guitar solo
After the guitar solo

Clean from an old white dude, he got a deal
And at the gas station where he got killed
Late night filling up, niggas shot him up
Asleep when the call came, news when I woke up
 carjacked, dead at the Mobil
I swear I shed a tear every time I see a photo
Now I'm all grown up same spot cop Swishers
Old school Chevy check the rear view mirror
Give a bum a buck, show the lil niggas love
Pocket full of kush, so I hit 'em with a nug
My homie left the hood, I ain't seen him in a minute
Pull up smoking reggie with his bitch in a rental
He said I just got out"" and can I let him hold something
I told him that I'm broke, man I ain't got nothing

And I'm out Aight then)
In a ' Cutty 'bout to go pick up a light skin

Blowing on some kush the color Minnesota Viking
And I'm out Aight then)
Catch me swooping up a freak and I'm knowing how my night ends
And I'm out Aight then)
Saying killa has some lightning, pipe blue or pipe thin

See this is all we know
Just running 'round the hood dog with nowhere to go
Wanna grab some Swishers but the narcs at the store
So we parked at my man's, put the chronic on hold
So now we just posting, drinking on some 's
My nigga got his  said drop him at his shorty's
Told my nigga chill, 'bout to roll one with hash
Soon as the hook leave then my nigga we can smash
All in rotation, puffpuff passing
Eyes like cherries through magnifying glasses
Think I got the munchies, my nigga, you hungry?
'Bout to run to Cork Town grab us some mudgies
The blunt turned to ash, gave a dap and laughed
Drunk the rest of the , threw the bottle in the trash
Made sure I had my phone, grabbed a square out the pack
Gave my homie that, jumped in the Cutty then I smashed

Just escape for the moment and let your problems rest
I mean I'll really pay attention
Tell me 'bout that bitch you hate, and this time I really listen

Wanna see that pretty smile, so what you wanna do?
Go to the movies, plan next day shopping?

Take you out the D, away from all the city fumes
Leave your job behind, don't even worry 'bout school

Playin' in the sand, watchin' waves, 'till we sleep
Wake up in the morning, eat breakfast on the rooftop

Your baby mama begged me to suck my dick
And I ain't gon' let her, she look like Predator
You a gay boy like David Archuleta
Contra, where niggas pierce armor
It's two niggas, two guns, blowing out your conscience
You see them chrome 's, in this bitch with thirty men
Y'all niggas know the code like..

Feel like I got a code in like I got  lives
Know they wanna see the Hybrid die
But my eyes never close to meet death's cousin
I ain't never slipping, even when I'm buzzing
Staying on my guard like a boxer on a rope
You get fucked quick tryna play me like a ho
Don't act like you ain't know that, I flash it like Kodak
Now your pics is on obituary
You a fairy that touch nigga's nuts

Mimic what I heard, got sicker with the verbs
Figured this the quickest way to get the picket in the 'burbs

Two Steps Back,Danny Brown,Hot Soup,"{'year': 2008, 'month': 7, 'day': 1}","Seen niggas lose lives over eight ball money
Seen crack babies grow up to serve their mommy
Can't explain why we live with so much sorrow
Guess the stories of today'll be a movie tomorrow
Mama always said there'd be days like this
Ain't got my own pot so in the alley I piss
I'll risk my own life to be rich
Workin' like a slave for them chains and whips
I daydream around palm trees
Blowin' haze in the day, summertime breeze
But in reality I just blow my breath
Let the Michigan cold numb my flesh
I need a tissue 'cause my nose is runnin'
Faced harsh winters, locked hot summer
Fuck the president, and the next running
None of them niggas gon' let me hold something

I take one step forward and two steps back
Nobody gets nowhere like that
I take one step forward and two steps back
Nobody gets through life like that
I take one step forward and two steps back
Nobody gets through life like that
Take one step forward and two steps back
Nobody gets nowhere like that

At night I lay in bed and just pray I can sleep
Think about my life with the TV on the blink
Starin' at the ceiling, I just think
Should I write my own will?"" but I ran outta ink
Ask God questions almost every day
I almost get my answers a damn year later
I roll gan that tastes like nowandlaters
Spit for crack babies
Layin' incubators
This is for my niggas workin' nine to five
They wanna beat they boss ass but they gotta survive
For the ones who hustle, had to slow up
'Cause they wanna be around and see their kids grow up
My boy got a chain for his th birthday
Went to school, niggas jumped him the next day
Truthfully, they took his honesty
'Cause now my nigga locked up for two armed robberies

One step forward and two steps back
Nobody gets through life like that
I take one step forward and two steps back
Nobody gets nowhere like that
I take one step forward and two steps back
Nobody gets through life like that
I take one step forward and two steps back

Niggas dreamin' 'bout piff, but we rolling up reg
Still scream, though his momma say, never leave the backyard""
Niggas out shooting, used condoms on the playground
Stay 'round crackheads, squatting out vacant flats
Teen girls getting raped, man it's all fact
Hooks swoop up, take your money and your crack
Might get your weed back, put your ass out the back
Starvin', narcs comin' we chalking
Run up, stash the work, get the guns out the closet
Seen niggas in the county get they brains stomped out
While the dep's did nothing they just stood there and watched
Tired of Coney, motor city got me lonely
For security, I got the . on me
Crib's rent unpaid, bills in the mailbox
Letter from your cousin on the bloc, man it stay hot
Most niggas I grew up with that are locked up
Are lost to a trap, leave their ass, stuck
And most souls I know got babies or a lady
Never met a old chick that tell me that she married
It's crazy in a city where there's money to gamble
But lookin' at the scenery, it's all in shambles
I lay back, reminisce on earlier times
There's nothing happy here, it's a Detroit state of mind

When the moon come out, and the sun don't shine
I be on the corner all day continuing the grind
When the sun comes up that just let me know the time
There's nothing happy here, it's a Detroit state of mind
When the moon come out, and the sun don't shine
I be on the corner all day continuing the grind
When the sun comes up that just let me know the time
There's nothing happy here, it's a Detroit state of mind

At the Cabernet, late night, saturday
Tight fitted, drunk off hennessey, I put the gat away
I'm nervous 'bout it cause these niggas lookin' kinda strange
As I have them very thoughts, niggas got it in the brain
I'm headed for the exit, while I'm slipping on champagne
Kicking bottles on the floor, I'm just trying to hit the door
And everybody else too ain't tryna get trampled
Heard two shots, tripped, and twisted my ankle
And we can never party, a bunch of hatin' niggas
In a city that's corrupted with some grimeyass bitches
Could be your best friend or even your relative
Snitch on you or put the . in your grill
And nigga that ain't right, niggas your whole life
When you get locked won't send you a kite
I lay back, reflect, think of earlier times
There's nothing happy here, it's a Detroit state of mind
When the moon come out, and the sun don't shine
I be on the corner all day continuing the grind
When the sun comes up that just let me know the time
There's nothing happy here, it's a Detroit state of mind
When the moon come out, and the sun don't shine

Get drunker than your mother or your nephew
But scared of her potato salad, Imma doggie bag it
Open pear addict, got me licking on my fingers like that crack addict
And I want a cheeseburger
All the blunts and purple got my stomach doing circles
Gettin' wild on belle isle corona case and sunset yoga of patrone

Way It Goes,Danny Brown,Detroit State of Mind 3,"{'year': 2009, 'month': 1, 'day': 1}","Look into my eyes, know you see a thug
Cause I dropped out of school to smoke weed and sell drugs
When you listen to me speak, uneducated
Cause I talk with Ebonics and I never graduated
So I'm a lost cause, gun in my drawers
Live another day, seem I got to break the law
Say this another way to put food on my plate
My daughter still hungry at the minimum wage
So you take away my days, put me in a cell
Pray every night, think I should burn in hell?
Lie to me as a kid, say I had a future
But I learned the truth when my mama rent was due
Said you was being honest, gave me a false promise
So I depend on nothing but this bottle and some chronic
Told me that if I change, I might just see dollars
But instead I got change and all it was, was copper

When does it end, God, I don't really know
Might be the state pen' or getting buried in a hole
But that's just the way it go
That's just the way it go
That's just the way it go
That's just the way it go
When does it end, God, I don't really know
Might be the state pen' or getting buried in a hole
But that's just the way it go
That's just the way it go
That's just the way it go
That's just the way it go

Even died in a dream
No niggas doing life, some ain't make 
Young whores in the hood take lies before they start
Robbed of selfesteem, now, they ain't got a heart
Staring in the mirror, hearing voices in my head
Saying: Take advantage cause you're 'posed to been dead""
Staying on a mission for the nickels and the dimes
Blowing on chronic while I'm peeking out the blinds
Sign of the time, ain't no respect
Can't leave the house if I ain't got the Tec
At night, I can't sleep, like a Vietnam vet
Can't trust my own blood, everybody is a threat
Paranoid, keep the heater off safety
Roll my own weed, nobody can't lace me
World crazy, lost my mind
But I'd rather be here than locked doing time

When does it end, God, I don't really know
Might be the state pen' or getting buried in a hole
But that's just the way it go
That's just the way it go
That's just the way it go

One Day It Could Happen,Danny Brown,Detroit State of Mind,"{'year': 2007, 'month': 8, 'day': 30}","The oldest of all kids, you can see my ribs
Hunger pains since the days of having stains on my bib
Used the same passion to put the 'caine on the strip
Used the same thirst when I put the bang in the whip
Whoever thought that I would make it with bars?
Used to give fiends ? just to borrow the car
I was just a teenager down on my luck
Thought Jordans and a gold chain was living it up
Only I'd have left mustard stains on my shirt
KoolAid and fuego helped clench my thirst
Used to live daytoday and just wait on the first
Then I lost my first daughter then I seen my work
Had to take steps back, reconstruct my plan
Started rapping up verses, stopped rapping up grams
Flew out to NY, fucking with my mans
Now I'm in the Maybach not the back of the van

My momma used to tell me Son, you're gonna make it, one day it'll happen""
Who knew I had what it takes to be famous and one day I'd be rapping
My poppa used to ask me Son, are you prepared cos one day it could happen""
I dreamed about this day, but who could've believed that one day I'd be rapping

Back on public transportation
Waking up in the morning with mason
Momma in the kitchen cooking eggs and bacon
Granny gave her last to the preacher man praying
For her grandson to make a change
Constant fiends coming copping with loose change
Was going down the drain, until I hopped on the beat and unleashed my pain
I used to watch wrestling, Hacksaw Jim Duggan
Piledrive beats, Dan Brown been thugging
Whole life been broke, I'ma keep on hustling
Tryna stack up a mill, cop a crib for my cousin
But, everywhere you go people wanna hate
Saying that they ? but they plotting on your plate
Taught in the streets, I ain't have to graduate
And nigga, I'ma make it just awaiting my day

I dreamed about this day, but who could've believed that one day I'd be rapping

People look at my style, momma look at your child
They throw my jams on now, watch the crowd go wild
We done came a long way form copping on broadway
Letting the arms spray, I'd walk in in broad day
Now we entrepreneurs that's concurring tours
The only thing left now to do is sell out stores
But in the hood, I'm platinum, did good with rapping
Money is stacking, done with the slinging and jacking
Now I write and recite what goes on in my life
Remember being too scared to come home at night
Cos I would hate to see you and my father fight
Back then I was a little dude
That rock's skips to school and got ridiculed
Quit the flip and a hit a fool
And I know it's hard, we went through many changes
Tryna raise a son that spoke a different language
But had to change my ways cos I was living dangerous

Nigga why you hatin' I could make your brain pop out that
Tiger fitted cap like a fuckin' toaster strudel
Man I peel yo' top like a cup of ramen noodles
I speak soft so the clothes look loud
And you might got swagger but you aint got style
Don't rock bling bling, the bitches like, wow""
Versace lookin new, I ain't worn this in a while

And I'm on that
You know I'm on that
On my shit, I'm on my shit
Yeah, it's true, it's true
Ain't that right
Nah

Long as the sun shine, the hybrid got rhymes
Used to have them trays like the school lunch lines
Gourmet rhymes, yours like school lunch
Drunk the bottle on my own just like can of punch (?)
At the school dance nigga Ima start a fight
You wanna pop yo ass and I'm fucking up yo night
Best dressed, class clown, nigga you a fool
This rap shit to me sorta light high school
Fuck the crack game if you ain't got muscle
Whoever said that, man they could not hustle
Around my hood, nigga what's good

One time
Uh
Yeah
One step
Uh
Yeah
It's one step at a time
Its what I do with the rhyme
Yeah
Uh
Yo

If that knife's too short take one step closer
Two steps from hell so a step from being over
A step from the pen but I dripped on this rap shit
Now I'm bout to take one step in a mansion
Bitches say I'm handsome
But know I ain't made it yet
The journey of a million miles begin with one step
Niggas show me love, I think it's all fake 'causе
Deep in they heart I know it's one stеp from hate
So they can suck a dick, I really don't care
Elevator to success is broke, I gotta take the stairs
A step at a time, left and right
Niggas need to quit rapping, take a step from the mic
Rappers terrified, I look 'em in they eyes
They give me  and give me highfives
But I know they scared, tonight dont get smeared
Cause courage is just one step from fear

I can't think of the rhyme so
I take it one step at a time
Uh, I cant think of the rhyme so
I take it one step at a time
Uh, I can't think of the rhyme so
I take it one step at a time
Uh, one step at a time
Uh, just one step at a time

They say a honest man will stay behind opportunity
So I cut in front of liars, spit truancy
I'm nice 'cause I skipped school to write
Nigga I dont feel ya
Far from a failure
The bitch is a popoff
Work in the sock drawer
Banging that Tupac
A step from a outlaw
Kush switch to southpaw
Leave a nigga jaw rocked
Yo, you don't know who we are?
Darg you just a step from the ER
We throw them Bs up but darg we ain't a Blood
Only rep green, fuck money, that's bud
I'm like Aye cuz I'm tryna get high""
And this kush got me one step from alive
Roll another blunt,  another five
Talking 'bout fifty, anybody with me
On thee neck heavy, fuck a record label
So if that means I'm one step from cable
Do it for success, my nigga, fuck a deal
 peel
Like it's a Happy Meal
A step from a overdose
Uh, I can't think of the rhyme so
I take it one step at a time
Uh, I can't think of the rhyme so
I take it one step at a time
One step at a time"

Yeah
Mm shawty alright doe, you know?
Keep a nigga right
Uh, uh, uh

Sunday, brunch at noon
The game 'bout to come on soon
Blunts in the sunshine, we ain't worried 'bout bloom
Wouldn't wanna be anywhere, just here with you
Take a break from the studio, away from my due
Last night they say two niggas got shot on the news
So I cut my phone off, I ain't shooting no moves
Chilling barefoot, laying up with my boo
And her tiny boy shorts and her small wifebeater
Hair messy and I still wanna eat her
She ain't gotta worry where I'ma be neither
You can feel the love vibrating through the speaker
'Cause last night it was VIP
Kush blunts, cases of 
Face another week when we 'pposed to be in church
But we seen too many funerals that when we there it hurts
So...

Let's just chill
Let's settle down
Hang out and fool around
Let's just chill
Ain't nowhere to go
So shawty just take off your clothes
And, uhm...
Let's just chill
Fuck the foreplay
Let's walk around naked all day
Like...
Let's just chill
So let's get it popping
Do it 'til the cops come knocking

You know I ain't never met nobody like you
Yeah, shawty keeping it a hundred man
Shot a nigga wide open, you know?
Yeah, uh, check
Uh, uh, uh
Uh, uh

You want a foot rub? Better yet, a back massage?
Or watch some porn? Put a scene with a menage a trois
I'm loving how you got them titties out like Mardi Gras
I'm in my boxers, rolling up with my dick hard
Let's take a bath together, put some bubbles in it
Baby, mac and cheese was banging, know you put some loving in it
Had a nigga full, getting all sleepy
Until you pulled my wee wee out and got freaky
Had her own plans, took off to spend time
I put it in, she can feel it in her spine
A dime in my eyes but she worth way more
And this the one thing that I would pay for
And that's her attention, she got me feeling special
That's why when we're together I put in extra effort
Feel it in my heart every time that we together
So let's play keeps with and make it last forever
Let's just chill
Let's settle down
Hang out and fool around
Let's just chill
Ain't nowhere to go
So shawty just take off your clothes

Yeah
Dance wit me
Yeah, yeah
Uh, uh

Get up broke as fuck
Do a blunt, gotta go to work
Call in? No way
Can't do it 'cause tonight I get paid
And this that night where we get right
Blowing that kush that tastes like Sprite
Really wanna quit, tell my boss eat a dick
But I got light bills, phone bills

Feels like life going downhill
So we chase these cheap thrills
Fill voids of pain we feel
Okay, okay, can't wait
So hard to get through this day
Been waiting all week for this chance
To go out tonight and just dance

Just dance to me
Uh, yeah, yeah, yeah

Get up drunk as fuck
Kinda late, still gotta go to work
Call in? No way
Get fired if I miss another day
And I hate when I wake in the day
On the way to work, gotta think of lots to say
Month been worse
Feeling like I'm cursed
Homeboy just took a ride in a hearse
And I think life's ill, life's ill

Feels like life going downhill
So we chase these cheap thrills
Fill voids of pain we feel
Okay, okay, can't wait
So hard to get through this day
Been waiting all week for this chance
To go out tonight and just dance

Yeah, yeah, yeah
Just dance wit me
