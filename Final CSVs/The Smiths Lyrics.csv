There Is a Light That Never Goes Out,The Smiths,The Queen is Dead,"{'year': 1986, 'month': 6, 'day': 16}","Take me out tonight
Where there's music and there's people
And they're young and alive
Driving in your car
I never, never want to go home
Because I haven't got one anymore
Take me out tonight
Because I want to see people
And I want to see lights
Driving in your car, oh, please don't drop me home
Because it's not my home, it's their home
And I'm welcome no more

And if a doubledecker bus crashes into us
To die by your side is such a heavenly way to die
And if a ten tonne truck kills the both of us
To die by your side, well, the pleasure, the privilege is mine

Take me out tonight
Take me anywhere
I don't care, I don't care, I don't care
And in the darkened underpass
I thought Oh God, my chance has come at last""
But then a strange fear gripped me and I just couldn't ask
Take me out tonight
Oh, take me anywhere
I don't care, I don't care, I don't care
Driving in your car, I never, never want to go home
Because I haven't got one
Ladeedum, oh, I haven't got one
Ohoh, ohohoh

And if a doubledecker bus crashes into us
To die by your side is such a heavenly way to die
And if a ten tonne truck kills the both of us
To die by your side, well, the pleasure, the privilege is mine

Oh, there is a light and it never goes out
There is a light and it never goes out
There is a light and it never goes out
There is a light and it never goes out
There is a light and it never goes out
There is a light and it never goes out
There is a light and it never goes out
There is a light and it never goes out"

That's why you're on your own tonight

To appear on the front of the Daily Mail
Dressed in your mother's bridal veil?

And I was shocked into shame to discover
How I'm the eighteenth pale descendent
Of some old queen or other

Oh, has the world changed or have I changed?
Some nine year old tough who peddles drugs
I swear to God, I swear I never even knew what drugs were

So I broke into the Palace
With a sponge and a rusty spanner
She said, ""'Ey, I know you, and you cannot sing""
I said, That's nothing, you should hear me play piano""
We can go for a walk where it's quiet and dry
And talk about precious things
But when you are tied to your mother's apron
No one talks about castration

We can go for a walk where it's quiet and dry
And talk about precious things
Like love and law and poverty, ohohoh, ohohoh

We can go for a walk where it's quiet and dry
And talk about precious things
But the rain that flattens my hair, ohohoh
These are the things that kill me)
All their lies about makeup and long hair are still there

Past the pub that saps your body
And the church who'll snatch your money
The Queen is dead, boys
And it's so lonely on a limb
Pass the pub that wrecks your body
And the church, all they want is your money
The Queen is dead, boys
And it's so lonely on a limb
Life is very long when you're lonely
Life is very long when you're lonely
Life is very long when you're lonely
Life is very long when you're lonely

So I meet you at the cemetery gates
Keats and Yeats are on your side
A dreaded sunny day
So I meet you at the cemetery gates
Keats and Yeats are on your side
While Wilde is on mine

So we go inside and we gravely read the stones
All those people, all those lives
Where are they now?
Witha loves and hates and passions just like mine
They were born, and then they lived
And then they died
Seems so unfair, I want to cry

You say, ""'Ere thrice the sun done salutation to the dawn""
And you claim these words as your own
But I've read well and I've heard them said
A hundred times, maybe less, maybe more

If you must write prose and poems
The words you use should be your own
Don't plagiarise or take on loan
'Cause there's always someone, somewhere
With a big nose, who knows
And who trips you up and laughs when you fall
Who'll trip you up and laugh when you fall

You say, ""'Ere long done do does did""
Words which could only be your own
And then produce the text from whence was ripped
Some dizzy whore, 

A dreaded sunny day, so let's go where we're happy
And I meet you at the cemetery gates
Oh, Keats and Yeats are on your side
A dreaded sunny day, so let's go where we're wanted
And I meet you at the cemetery gates
Keats and Yeats are on your side, but you lose
'Cause whale blubber Wilde is on mmine Sugar)"

Where are they now?
With loves, with hates
And passions just like mine

And then they lived
And then they died

But Ive read well and I've heard them said
A hundred times, maybe less, maybe more

Theres always someone, somewhere
With a big nose, who knows
And who trips you up and laughs when you fall
Who'll trip you up and laugh when you fall

Words which could only be your own
And then produce the text
From whence was ripped

A dreaded sunny day
So let's go where we're happy
And I'll meet you at the cemetry gates
