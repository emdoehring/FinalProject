Step,Vampire Weekend,Modern Vampires of the City (Japan CD),"{'year': 2013, 'month': 5, 'day': 14}","Every time I see you in the world, you always step to my girl

Back, back, way back I used to front like Angkor Wat
Mechanicsburg, Anchorage and Dar es Salaam
While home in New York was champagne and disco
Tapes from LA. slash San Francisco
But actually Oakland and not Alameda
Your girl was in Berkeley with her Communist reader
Mine was entombed within boombox and Walkman
I was a hoarder, but girl, that was back then

The gloves are off, the wisdom teeth are out
What you on about?
I feel it in my bones
I feel it in my bones
I'm stronger now, I'm ready for the house
Such a modest mouse
I can't do it alone
I can't do it alone

Every time I see you in the world
You always step to my girl
Ancestors told me that their girl was better
She's richer than Croesus, she's tougher than leather
I just ignore all the tales of her past life
Stale conversation deserves but a bread knife
And punks who would laugh when they saw us together
Well, they didn't know how to dress for the weather
I can still see them there, huddled on Astor
Snow falling slow to the sound of the master

The gloves are off, the wisdom teeth are out
What you on about?
I feel it in my bones
I feel it in my bones
I'm stronger now, I'm ready for the house
Such a modest mouse
I can't do it alone
I can't do it alone

Wisdom's a gift, but you'd trade it for youth
Age is an honor, it's still not the truth
We saw the stars when they hid from the world
You cursed the sun when it stepped to your girl
Maybe she's gone and I can't resurrect her
The truth is she doesn't need me to protect her
We know the true death, the true way of all flesh
Everyone's dying, but girl, you're not old yet
Gloves are off, the wisdom teeth are out
What you on about?
I feel it in my bones
I feel it in my bones
I'm stronger now, I'm ready for the house
Such a modest mouse
I can't do it alone
I can't do it alone
Gloves are off, the wisdom teeth are out
What you on about?
I feel it in my bones
I feel it in my bones
I'm stronger now, I'm ready for the house
Such a modest mouse
I can't do it alone
I can't do it alone

Every time I see you in the world
You always step to my girl"
Unbelievers,Vampire Weekend,Modern Vampires of the City (Japan CD),"{'year': 2013, 'month': 5, 'day': 13}","Got a little soul
The world is a cold, cold place to be
Want a little warmth
But who's going to save a little warmth for me?
We know the fire awaits unbelievers
All of the sinners the same
Girl, you and I will die unbelievers
Bound to the tracks of the train

If I'm born again
I know that the world will disagree
Want a little grace
But who's gonna say a little grace for me?

We know the fire awaits unbelievers
All of the sinners the same
Girl, you and I will die unbelievers
Bound to the tracks of the train

I'm not excited, but should I be?
Is this the fate that half of the world has planned for me?
I know I love you, and you love the sea
But what holy water contains a little drop, little drop for me?

See the sun go down
It's going on down and the night is deep
Want a little light
But who's gonna save a little light for me?

We know the fire awaits unbelievers
All of the sinners the same
Girl, you and I will die unbelievers
Bound to the tracks of the train

Oxford Comma,Vampire Weekend,Vampire Weekend,"{'year': 2007, 'month': 6, 'day': 16}","Who gives a fuck about an Oxford comma?
I've seen those English dramas too; they're cruel
So if there's any other way to spell the word
It's fine with me, with me

Why would you speak to me that way?
Especially when I always said that I
Haven't got the words for you
All your diction dripping with disdain
Through the pain, I always tell the truth

Who gives a fuck about an Oxford comma?
I climbed to Dharamsala too, I did
I met the highest Lama
His accent sounded fine to me, to me

Take your handbook, it's no trick
Take the chapstick, put it on your lips
Crack a smile, adjust my tie
Know your boyfriend, unlike other guys

Why would you lie 'bout how much coal you have?
Why would you lie about something dumb like that?
Why would you lie 'bout anything at all?
First the window, then it's to the wall
Lil Jon, he always tells the truth


Check your passport, it's no trick
Take the chapstick, put it on your lips
Crack a smile, adjust my tie
Know your butler, unlike other guys

Why would you lie 'bout how much coal you have?
Why would you lie about something dumb like that?
Why would you lie 'bout anything at all?
First the window, then it's to the wall
Why would you tape my conversations?
Show your paintings at the United Nations
Lil Jon, he always tells the truth"

But I could not believe it
'Til me and Hannah Hunt
Saw crawling vines and weeping willows
As we made our way from Providence to Phoenix

A man of faith said hidden eyes
Could see what I was thinking
I just smiled and told him
That was only true of Hannah
And we glided on through Waverly and Lincoln

Our days were long, our nights no longer
Count the seconds, watching hours
Though we live on the US dollar
You and me, we got our own sense of time

In Santa Barbara, Hannah cried
I miss those freezing beaches""
And I walked into town
To buy some kindling for the fire
Hannah tore the New York Times up into pieces

If I can't trust you then damn it, Hannah
There's no future, there's no answer
Though we live on the US dollar
You and me, we got our own sense of time

If I can't trust you then damn it, Hannah
There's no future, there's no answer
Though we live on the US dollar
You and me, we got our own sense of time"

Out of control but you're playing a role

Harmony Hall,Vampire Weekend,Father of the Bride,"{'year': 2019, 'month': 1, 'day': 24}","We took a vow in summertime
Now we find ourselves in late December
I believe that New Year's Eve
Will be the perfect time for their great surrender
But they don't remember

Anger wants a voice, voices wanna sing
Singers harmonize 'til they can't hear anything
I thought that I was free from all that questionin'
But every time a problem ends, another one begins

And the stone walls of Harmony Hall bear witness
Anybody with a worried mind could never forgive the sight
Of wicked snakes inside a place you thought was dignified
I don't wanna live like this, but I don't wanna die

Ooh, ooh, ooh
I don't wanna live like this, but I don't wanna die

Within the halls of power lies a nervous heart that beats
Like a Young Pretender's
Beneath these velvet gloves I hide
The shameful, crooked hands of a moneylender
'Cause I still remember

Anger wants a voice, voices wanna sing

And show me where to find the surgeons knife

The punishment I needed all my life

Listen to my bum rap, listen to the evidence
Exonerating me from being right

Show sympathy to LA where the sun don't ever shine

Cursed by curiosity that made us go inside

Would have broken yours
And thrown the pieces in the river

Now we've got that sympathy
What I'm to you, you are to me
Let's go

Sympa—
Sympa—
Let's go
Sympa—
Let's go
Sympa—

Desperate for an enemy, but too afraid to kill
Use the pain of someone else and triumph for their will
And spill the blood
Of the arrogant mosquitoes

Step (Remix),Vampire Weekend,Unbelievers - EP,"{'year': 2014, 'month': 1, 'day': 1}","Every time I see you in the world, you always step to my girl

Back, back, way back, I used to front like I was Don Juan
Couldn't settle down, couldn't find a girl to hold on
Used to get my roll on, hit the spots and stroll on
Now I found one with a hand I like to hold on
Every time I'm with her, dudes always wanna stare
I be staring back like, You don't wanna go there""
Used to didn't care, now I hit you with a chair
If it just so happen, touch a string on her hair
Now me and shorty wop spending more and more time
So since she got my heart then I gotta have her spine
And if any dude try to come for what's mine
A pair of size nines where the sun don't shine
The sugar in my KoolAid, boo gets me through days
Swear to God, one day I might watch her throw a bouquet
Said, Nowhere on this earth, nowhere in this world
I should ever, ever see you stepping to my girl""
That's my old girl, my old girl from college
I always think about her when the leaves turn orange
Yeah, we went to Wesleyan and she scoffed at Vassar
I met her at a wine and cheese, I looked right past her
Apparently, she would notify me right after
I smashed her the first night, the first pipe's the worst pipe
But after, I satisfied thirst like, Mmm""
The pastor would satisfy the church like
She lived in WestCo and she studied frescoes
And head to toes, she stayed in the best clothes
I represent Queens, she would move out to Brooklyn
Never thought that she would have her precious heart tooken
By a shy, brown guy from Bellerose
That stayed in shelltoes, until Hell froze
Her freckles dance on her porcelain skin
It's like, she's got a special force within
And I been high, but ain't no higher place
Than alongside her by the fireplace

Act like you ain't even seen me standing next to her
I'll tie your kicks together if you ever try and step to her
Must be why you trippin' when I ask you, Why you stressin' her?""
Passing notes and texting her, I'm 'bout to shoot the messenger
Used to smash, slap 'em on the ass and go away
They ask when I'mma call 'em and I hit 'em with a poker face
Coldest shoulder known to blow a load
Then leave 'em froze and skate
Magnum wrapper in the trash, I told them, Nothing gold can stay""
Who's she? Guess I turned over a new leaf
Now I'm choosing groups 'A' through 'D' over groupies
Lose sleep, lately only counting on these two sheep
You and me, baby, skippin' town up on these coupe seats
Must've broke the mold when they made you
Probably broke a nail or two flippin' off these lame dudes
Hollerin' in plain view, on some, What's your name, boo?""
Barely had a dollar and a dream, but it came true

The gloves are off, the wisdom teeth are out
What you on about?
I feel it in my bones, I feel it in my bones
I'm stronger now, I'm ready for the house
Such a modest mouse, I can't do it alone, I can't do it alone
Every time I see you in the world, you always step to my girl"

We got married in a gold rush
And the rush has never felt the same

Shared a kiss in pouring rain

I don't wanna hear the rumors, please don't say it loud
I just wanna go out tonight and make my baby proud

There's two seats on the midnight train

All that loving turned to hate

Everything was ours, now its just an empty mine
Animals don't understand the words on the danger sign
For them, it's just some shade from the morning shine
I thought you might learn the language
I thought you might learn to sing
We were born before the gold rush
So why can't I remember anything?
I want to put things back together
I wanna give, dont wanna take
Time to disavow the gold rush
And the bitterness that's flourished in its wake

The kids don't stand a chance

The kids don't stand
The kids don't stand
The kids don't stand a chance
The kids don't stand
The kids don't stand
The kids don't stand a chance

You criticize the practice
By murdering their plants
Ignoring all the history
Denying them romance

The pinstriped men of morning
Are coming forward to dance
Fortymillion dollars
The kids don't stand a chance

The kids don't stand
The kids don't stand
The kids don't stand a chancе
The kids don't stand
The kids don't stand
The kids don't stand a chancе

Didn't like the business
But that was at first glance
Your pillow feels so soft now
But still you must advance

The pinstriped men of morning
The partners in the dance
The paper's shot to pieces
The kids don't stand a chance
The kids don't stand
The kids don't stand
The kids don't stand a chance
The kids don't stand
The kids don't stand
The kids don't stand a chance

Haven't got the words for you
All your diction dripping with disdain
Through the pain, I always tell the truth

I climbed to Dharamsala too, I did
I met the highest Lama
His accent sounded fine to me, to me

Take the chapstick, put it on your lips
Crack a smile, adjust my tie
Know your boyfriend, unlike other guys

Why would you lie 'bout how much coal you have?
Why would you lie about something dumb likе that?
Why would you lie 'bout anything at all?

Why would you tape my conversations?

You broke my heart at midnight mass
Now I'm the ghost of Christmas past
The only choice you gave to me
Is one I took reluctantly
'Cause when we play democracy
You always take immunity

What's the point of human beings?

Why's it felt like Halloween since Christmas ?

The car's on Sunset Boulevard

Neither of us has the key

The hills will fall eventually
