The Mariner’s Revenge Song,The Decemberists,Picaresque,"{'year': 2005, 'month': 3, 'day': 22}","We are two mariners, our ships' sole survivors
In this belly of a whale
Its ribs our ceiling beams, its guts our carpeting
I guess we have some time to kill
You may not remember me, I was a child of three
And you, a lad of eighteen
But I remember you, and I will relate to you
How our histories interweave
At the time you were a rake and a roustabout
Spending all your money on the whores and hounds
Ohohhhhh

You had a charming air, all cheap and debonair
My widowed mother found so sweet
And so she took you in, her sheets still warm with him
Now filled with filth and foul disease
As time wore on, you proved a debtridden drunken mess
Leaving my mother a poor consumptive wretch
Ohohhhhh

And then you disappeared, your gambling arrears
The only thing you left behind
And then the magistrate reclaimed our small estate
And my poor mother lost her mind
Then, one day in Spring, my dear sweet mother died
But before she did, I took her hand as she, dying, cried:
Ohohhhhh

Find him, bind him
Tie him to a pole and break his fingers to splinters
Drag him to a hole until he wakes up, naked
Clawing at the ceiling of his grave""
Death rattle*

It took me fifteen years to swallow all my tears
Among the urchins in the street
Until a priory took pity and hired me
To keep their vestry nice and neat
But never once in the employ of these holy men
Did I ever once turn my mind from the thought of revenge
Ohohhhhh

One night I overheard the Prior exchanging words
With a penitent whaler from the sea
The captain of his ship, who matched you toe to tip
Was known for wanton cruelty
The following day, I shipped to sea with a privateer
And in the whistle of the wind I could almost hear...
Ohohhhhh

Find him, bind him
Tie him to a pole and break his fingers to splinters
Drag him to a hole until he wakes up, naked
Clawing at the ceiling of his grave""
There is one thing I must say to you
As you sail across the sea
Always, your mother will watch over you
As you avenge this wicked deed""

And then that fateful night, we had you in our sight
After twenty months at sea
Your starboard flank abeam, I was getting my muskets clean
When came this rumbling from beneath
The ocean shook, the sky went black, and the captain quailed
As before us grew the angry jaws of a giant whale
Oh, oh Screaming)
Oh Screaming)

Don't know how I survived, the crew all was chewed alive
I must have slipped between his teeth
But, oh, what providence, what divine intelligence!
That you should survive as well as me
It gives my heart great joy to see your eyes fill with fear
So lean in close and I will whisper the last words you'll hear
Oh, oh

I pulled my coat tight
Against the falling down
And the sun was all
And the sun was all down

I haven't wealth nor fame
I have my two hands
And a house to my name
And the winter's so
And the winter's so long
And the winter's so
And the winter's so long
And all the stars were crashing 'round
As I laid eyes on what I'd found
It was a white crane
It was a helpless thing
Upon a red stain
With an arrow in its wing
And it called and cried
And it called and cried so
And it called and cried
And it called and cried so
And all the stars were crashing 'round
As I laid eyes on what I'd found
My crane wife, my crane wife
My crane wife, my crane wife
And now I helped her
And now I dressed her wounds
And how I held her
Beneath the rising moon
And she stood to fly
And she stood to fly away
And she stood to fly
She stood to fly away
And all the stars were crashing 'round
As I laid eyes on what I'd found
My crane wife, my crane wife
My crane wife, my crane wife

My crane wife arrived at my door in the moonlight
All star bright and tonguetied I took her in
We were married and bells rang sweet for our wedding
And our bedding was ready when we fell in
Sound the keening bell
And see it's painted red
Soft as fontanelle
The feathers and the thread
And all I ever meant to do was to keep you
My crane wife
My crane wife
My crane wife
We were poorly, our fortunes fading hourly
And how she vowed me, she could bring it back
But I was greedy, I was vain and I forced her to weaving
On cold loom, in a closed room, with down wove
Sound the keening bell
And see it's painted red
Soft as fontanelle
The feathers and the thread
And all I ever meant to do was to keep you
My crane wife
My crane wife
My crane wife
There's a bend in the wind and it rakes at my heart
There is blood in the thread and it rakes at my heart
It rakes at my heart

And I marched the streets of Birkenau
And I recall in spring
The perfume that the air would bring
To the indolent town
Where the barkers call the moon down

There's nothing that I wouldn't do
Save lay my rifle down

And I built this balustrade
To keep you home, to keep you safe
From the outside world

Even though my work is unparalleled
They never seemed to meet
This structure fell about our feet
And we were free to go

Have fallen 'neath my tender hand
When their husbands were not around
But you, my soiled teenage girlfriend
O' how you furrow like a lioness
And we are vagabonds
We travel without seatbelts on
To live this close to death

In the summer of my twentyfirst year
And the bells rang for our wedding
Only now do I remember it clear

Alright, alright, alright

No more a rake and no more a bachelor
I was wedded and it whetted my thirst
Until her womb start spilling out babies
Only then did I reckon my curse

Alright, alright, alright
Alright, alright, alright

First came Isaiah with his crinkled little fingers
Then came Charlotte and that wretched girl Dawn
Ugly Myfanwy died on delivery
Mercifully taking her mother along

Alright, alright, alright

What can one do when one is widower
Shamefully saddled with three little pests?
All that I wanted was the freedom of a new life
So my burden I began to divest

Alright, alright, alright
Alright, alright, alright

Charlotte, I buried after feeding her foxglove
Dawn was easy, she was drowned in the bath
Isaiah fought but was easily bested
Burned his body for incurring my wrath

Alright, alright, alright

And that's how I came, your humble narrator
To be living so easy and free
Expect that you'd think that I should be haunted
But it never really bothers me

Alright, alright, alright

Sucker’s Prayer,The Decemberists,I’ll Be Your Girl,"{'year': 2018, 'month': 3, 'day': 16}","I was not ready for the road
I was so discontent to wear that heavy load
And so I got down on my knees
Made a sucker's prayer
Like Rimbaud to Baudelaire before

And when nobody did respond
I took my glasses off and went to find a pond
Stuffing rocks into the pockets of my pants
And when I waded in
Those currents carried them away

I wanna love somebody but I don't know how
I've been so long lonely and it's getting me down
I wanna throw my body in the river and drown
I wanna love somebody but I don't know how


So if you're lost along the way
And if you're thinking that will always be the case
Won't you listen to my plea?
You'll make a sucker's prayer
Just go and leave it thataway

I wanna love somebody but I don't know how

Like a lover undone by full moon
Like a lily alive in full bloom
I'll be your girl

And when the tempests rage
And all the oceans roar
At your door
I could be your man
But I'd be that much more
And more

So when everything soft abrades you
When fortune has long betrayed you
And you're longing for an arm to stay you
I'll be your girl

And when the tempests rage
And all the oceans roar
At your door
I could be your man
But I'd be that much more
And more

So if you're ever feeling less your time due
Like someone bereft and lied to
And you never need a guy to guide you
I'll be your girl
I'll be your girl
I'll be your girl"

There's an island hidden in the sound
Lapping currents lay your boat aground
Affix your barb and bayonet
The curlews carve their Arabesques
And sorrow fills the silence all around
Come and see

There's a harbor lost within the reeds
A jetty caught in overhanging trees
Among the bones of cormorants
No boot mark here nor fingerprint
The rivers roll down to a soundless sea
Come and see
Come and see

The tides will come and go
Witnessed by no waking eye
The willows mark the wind
And all we know for sure
Amidst this fading light
We'll not go home again
Come and see
Come and see

In the lowlands, nestled in the heath
A briarcradle rocks its babe to sleep
Its contents watched by Sycorax
And Patagon in parallax
A foretold rumbling sounds below the deep
Come and see
Come and see

The tides will come and go
Witnessed by no waking eye
The willows mark the wind
And all we know for sure
Amidst this fading light
We'll not go home again
Come and see

Lord, lord


I will dress your eyelids
With dimes upon your eyes
Lay you close to water

Go to sleep now, little ugly
Go to sleep now, you little fool
Forty winking in the belfry
You'll not feel the drowning
You'll not feel the drowning
Forget you once had sweethearts
They've forgotten you
Think you not on parents
They've forgotten too

Go to sleep now, little ugly
Go to sleep now, you little fool
Forty winking in the belfry
You'll not feel the drowning
You'll not feel the drowning

Heave his sorrowed cry
The weight upon your eyelids
Is dimes laid on your eyes"

Expanding out its empire by degrees

All dust and stone and moribund
I paid twentyfive cents to light

Then turned and weaved
Through slow decay
We were both a little hungry
So we went to get hot dog
Down to Hyde Street Pier
The light was slight and disappeared
The air it stunk of fish and beer
We heard a Superman trumpet
Play the national anthem
And the world may be long for you
But'll never belong to you
But on a motorbike
When all the city lights
Blind your eyes tonight
Are you feeling better now?
Some way to greet the year:
Your eyes all bright and
Brim with tears
The pilgrims, pills, and tourists here
Will sink fiftythree bucks to buy
A brand new halo
Sweet on a greeneyed girl
All fiery Irish clip and curl
All brine and piss and vinegar

And dared breach your rippling pool
As I lulled and lingered, the ring slipped my finger
And drifted down the deepening cool
And all that I want is to fall in your shallows

And bank to bank our property lay

That grow on the bank side along the salt sea

So to the wild rushes the wind carried me
The summer was here and the sun it was high
And to the wild rushes I came by and by
And there took my seat and dipped in my feet
When through the wild rushes, a voice sweetly cried:
Come down, my little darling, come closer to me
The water is warm; it is salty and free
I long for your touch but I won't ask too much
And I, being foolish, walked in to my knees
Come down, little darling, and lay at my breast
Oh come a little closer and I'll do the rest
I waited so long for a lover to come
And I, being foolish, walked in to my chest
Come down, my little darling, oh farther come in
For deeper the water, the sweeter the sin
My lily lies here, if you'd only draw near
And I, being foolish, went in to my chin
Oh come, my little darling, do you feel my cool breath?
Do you feel my arms around you so warm and so wet?

And crumpled old dollars
Which we squirreled away
In our rat trap hotel by the freeway

Your cool was contagious
At the old school
You left without leaving
A note for your grieving
Sweet mother, while
Your brother was so cruel
And here in the alleys
Your spirits were rallied
As you learned quick to make a fast buck
In bathrooms and barrooms
On dumpsters and heirlooms

Sucked our lips into our lungs

With one iron cue ball

And we laughed off the quick tricks--
The old men with limp dicks--
On the colonnades of the waterfront park

In the bus stop enclosure enfolding
Our hands tightly holding

I was working for the government
And in a bathroom stall off the National Mall
How we kissed so sweetly
How could I refuse a favor or two
For a tryst in the greenery
I gave you documents and microfilm, too
And from my ten floor tenement
Where once our bodies lay
How I long to hear you say
No, they'll never catch me now
No, they'll never catch me
No, they cannot catch me now

Somehow

I was awoken by the telephone
I heard a strangled cry on the end of the line
Purloined in Petrograd
They were suspicious of where your loyalties lay
So I paid off a bureaucrat
To convince your captors there to secret you away
And at the gate of the embassy
Our hands met through the bars
As your whisper stilled my heart
No, they'll never catch me now
No, they'll never catch me
No, they cannot catch me now

You were there in fours
Head held high

And whatever differences our lives have been
We together make a limb""

In the picture in your head
And remember how you found the key
To his hideout in the Pyrenees
But you wanted to keep his secret safe
So you threw the key away
This is the story of your gypsy uncle

This is the story of the boys who loved you
Who love you now, and loved you then
And some were sweet, and some were cold and snuffed you
And some just laid around in bed
Some had crumbled you straight to your knees
Did it cruel, did it tenderly
Some had crawled their way into your heart
To rend your ventricles apart

But I will cross if mine own horse is pulled from me
Though my mother cries that if I try I sure will drowned be
Will drowned be, will drowned be, will drowned be

You may render me a wreck when I come back
So calm your waves and slow the churn
And you may have my precious bones on my return

Hear her holler above your water's pall

And I would cross your breadth and rest my breast about her amber ring

Told her I would not return

For the worse now I fear
It's been a year or more
Since they shipped me to this foreign shore
Fighting in a foreign war
So far away from my home

Pinched doses of laudanum
Longing for the old fecundity of my homeland

A smattering of distant applause
Is ringing in my poor ears
On the old left bank
My baby in a charabanc
Riding up the width and length
Of the Champs Elysees

Through the lights of Beacon Street
And if you listen, you can hear her weeping
She's weeping
'Cause the gentlemen are calling
And the snow is softly falling on her petticoat
And she's standing in the harbor
And she's waiting for the sailors in the jolly boat
See how they approach
With dirty hands and trousers torn
They grapple till she's safe within their keeping
A gag is placed between her lips
To keep her sorry tongue from any speaking
Or screaming
And they row her out to packets
Where the sailors' sorry racket calls for maidenhead
And she's scarce above the gunwales
When her clothes fall to a bundle and she's laid in bed
On the upper deck
And so she goes from ship to ship
Her ankles clasped, her arms so rudely pinioned
'Till at last she's satisfied
The lot of the marina's teeming minions
In their opinions
And they tell her not to say a thing
To cousin, kindred, kith or kin or she'll end up dead
And they throw her dirty dollars
And return her to the harbor where she goes to bed
And this is how you're fed
So be kind to your mother
Though she may seem an awful bother
And the next time she tries to feed you collard greens
Remember what she does when you're asleep"

He is decked by a Japanese geisha with a garland of pearls
How she twists and twirls!

What I knew: it'd come back to you
Take this palm, follow the lines here are written
Tracing the bends and the shapes
And feel your fingers falling slack and all folding back
The tainted election, the hole in the sky
Command what is tried, what is true
But without solution, with feet on the ground

Because there on the timberline
Deep cold November shines through

And I spent all morning grieving
And everybody's saying that you'll take the news gracefully
Somehow I don't think I'll get off that easily

I meant her no harm
When I left her unlocked outside the Orange Street Food Farm
I was just running in, didn't think I'd be that long
I came out, she was gone
And all that was there was some bored old dog
Leashed up to the place where your bicycle had been
Guess we'll never see poor Madeleine again

Let this be consolation, Steven
That all the while you were in England
I treated her with care and respect and gave her lots of love
And I was usually pretty good 'bout locking her up

Where has she gone?
Well, I bet she's on the bottom of a Frenchtown pond
Rudely abused on some hesher's joyride
So I wrote you this song
In the hopes that you'd forgive me even though it was wrong
Being so careless with a thing so great
And taking your poor Madeleine away, away"

And then you hailed yourself a yellow cab

And I sat for a time by the valets in line
And I read what you wrote on the card
Above a cowboy you drew a big talk balloon
Saying Try not to take it so hard”

But theres this nagging suspicion that wont leave me alone tonight
Its just that everything I try to do, nothing seems to turn out right

We laid on our backs and stared at the ceiling
Messed with your slacks, but ended up just holding your hand
The rain will remain, the TV was telling
A drip of the drain as your legs lift to brilliantly bend
And fall to resting on the ottoman

So we turned off the tube and we crawled to your room
Leaving discarded clothes in our wake
And we both had some fun, though I twice bit my tongue
And it lasted too long for my taste


A wink and a wave and youre off to your familys

This fickle young sister's away in the dimming of night

Stateside,The Decemberists,Florasongs EP,"{'year': 2015, 'month': 10, 'day': 9}","You called, I was drowning weary after the bar
And the line couldn't hold you enough
You talked, I could hear you quiet between thoughts
And the time dragged divided aside
Will you call when you touch down?
When you come back around
Stateside
When you're stateside?
And now, here the growing call of the sun coming up
And I know I will never belong
Will you call when you touch down?
When you come back around
Stateside
When you're stateside?
When you're stateside

Royal David's city
Was bathed in the light of love
Jesus Christ was born today
Jesus Christ was born

Jesus Christ was born
And lo, they did rejoice
Fine and pure of voice
And the wrong shall fail
And the right prevail
Jesus Christ was born today

And we're gonna get born now

Death​-​Defying,The Decemberists,Good Music to Avert the Collapse of American Democracy,"{'year': 2020, 'month': 9, 'day': 4}","Ever since the world began, oohee
Men have sailed to foreign lands, oohee
And the fortune that they've found, oohee
Are now buried in the ground, oohee

Some would say the ocean roars, oohee
As it stumbles to the shore, oohee
But to me, it only sings, oohee
Of the sorrow that it brings, oohee

All my friends are dead or they're dying
And our laughter turns into crying
It's deathdefying

Well, I barely learned to swim, oohee
Just enough to save my skin, oohee
Now I'll never sail alone, oohee
And my harbour is my home, oohee

All my friends arе dead or they're dying
And our laughtеr turns into crying
It's deathdefying
Heyheyey
Heyey

If there's one thing that I've learned, oohee
It's the point of no return, oohee
And if that's to be our fate, oohee
Now's no time to hesitate, oohee

Now's no time to hesitate
Now's no time to hesitate"
