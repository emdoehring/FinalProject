Call Me Maybe,Carly Rae Jepson,Kiss,"{'year': 2011, 'month': 9, 'day': 20}","I threw a wish in the well
Don't ask me, I'll never tell
I looked to you as it fell
And now you're in my way
I trade my soul for a wish
Pennies and dimes for a kiss
I wasn't looking for this
But now you're in my way

Your stare was holdin'
Ripped jeans, skin was showin'
Hot night, wind was blowin'
Where you think you're going, baby?

Hey, I just met you and this is crazy
But here's my number, so call me, maybe
It's hard to look right at you, baby
But here's my number, so call me, maybe
Hey, I just met you and this is crazy
But here's my number, so call me, maybe
And all the other boys try to chase me
But here's my number, so call me, maybe

You took your time with the call
I took no time with the fall
You gave me nothin' at all
But still you're in my way
I beg and borrow and steal
At first sight and it's real
I didn't know I would feel it
But it's in my way

Your stare was holdin'
Ripped jeans, skin was showin'
Hot night, wind was blowin'
Where you think you're going, baby?

Hey, I just met you and this is crazy
But here's my number, so call me, maybe
It's hard to look right at you, baby
But here's my number, so call me, maybe
Hey, I just met you and this is crazy
But here's my number, so call me, maybe
And all the other boys try to chase me
But here's my number, so call me, maybe
Before you came into my life, I missed you so bad
I missed you so bad, I missed you so, so bad
Before you came into my life, I missed you so bad
And you should know that, I missed you so, so bad

It's hard to look right at you, baby
But here's my number, so call me, maybe
Hey, I just met you and this is crazy
But here's my number, so call me, maybe
And all the other boys try to chase me
But here's my number, so call me, maybe

Before you came into my life, I missed you so bad
I missed you so bad, I missed you so, so bad
Before you came into my life, I missed you so bad
And you should know that, so call me, maybe"

Let down my guard tonight
I just don't care anymore
And I've told a hundred lies
But I don't wanna tell you any at all

And I cannot control it
The way you're making me feel
And you have got me going
Spinning in circles in your warm blood

Warm blood feels good, I can't control it anymore
Sweet one, you should stop me there, but I keep on talking
I would throw in the towel for you, boy
'Cause you lift me up and catch me when I'm falling for you

You catch me when I'm falling for you
You catch me when I'm falling, falling
You catch me when I'm falling, falling for you

I saw myself tonight
Caught my reflection in the mirror
My hands and heart were tied
But I was scared of almost nothing at all

And I cannot control it
The way you're making me feel
And you have got me going
Spinning in circles in your warm blood

Warm blood feels good, I can't control it anymore
Sweet one, you should stop me there, but I keep on talking
I would throw in the towel for you, boy
'Cause you lift me up and catch me when I'm falling for you

Warm blood, underneath my skin
Warm blood, my heart is pumping
Warm blood, underneath my skin
Warm blood, my heart is pumping

Warm blood feels good, I can't control it anymore

Both our hands speak for us and complicate it
My home is your body, how can I stay away?
Away, away, away, away)
If my love's too strong for you, walk away
But I can't make this wrong when I see your face
My home is your body, how can I stay away?

Real Love,Carly Rae Jepson,Dedicated (Japan CD),"{'year': 2019, 'month': 5, 'day': 17}","The world is going crazy
And it feels like I just don't know who to trust sometimes
Something's coming over me, I need to get a hold of you now
We're getting good at lying
No one's saying what's keeping us all awake at night
Something's coming over me, I need to get a hold of you now

Standing here with you tonight, how do we turn on the light?
I've got the feeling that the writing's on the wall
And I'm so used to the lie, and you're so down to deny
I've got the feeling you're the right thing after all

I go everyday without it
All I want is real, real love
And I've been feeling weak without it
Only want a real, real love
I'm not even scared about it
All I want is real, real love
But I don't know a thing about it
All I want is real, real love

Real, real, real love
Real, real, real love
Real, real, real love

All the chaos falling 'round
I watch it like a movie that has come to life
Something kind of numb about the way I keep on drowning it out
Danger, I feel danger
And I cannot find the breath to scream the words out right
Every thought is paralyzing, need to find a way to you now

Standing here with you tonight, how do we turn on the light?
I've got the feeling that the writing's on the wall

Two step, making the weekend slide into something

'Cause it feels like I've never loved
Now I got ya, and I only think of you
'Cause it feels like I've never loved
Now I'd do, boy, anything to step with you

Waiting for the passing trains
Wishing you were here
Wishing we could run
Wishing we could run away

The leaves are gonna change us when they start to fall
Take us to the city, where we'll have it all
We'll have it all

Oh yeah, I would run away with you now
We could do the things we promised we would always do
Take a train to Timbuktu, we could join the circus
Oh yeah, would you just escape with me now?
We could do the things we promised, dreaming wide awake
Take me back to yesterday
We could be the runaways

Remember how that one time things were getting hard
I met you in your old backyard
We packed a couple bags and we stole your father's car
But we only ever got so far

We drove across the river, left the town so small
The leaves are gonna change you when they start to fall
If we make it to the city, then we'll have it all
We'll have it all

Maybe there is something the matter with me
I just, I don't see how a world that makes such wonderful things could be bad...

Look at this stuff
Isn't it neat?
Wouldn't you think my collection's complete?
Wouldn't you think I'm the girl, the girl who has everything?

Look at this trove
Treasures untold
How many wonders can one cavern hold?
Lookin' around here you'd think
Sure she's got everything

I've got gadgets and gizmos aplenty
I've got whozits and whatzits galore
You want thingamabobs? I got twenty
But who cares?
No big deal
I want more

I wanna be where the people are
I wanna see, wanna see 'em dancin'
Walkin' around on those
What do ya call 'em? Oh, feet!
Flippin' your fins, you don't get too far
Legs are required for jumpin', dancin'
Strollin' along down a
What's that word again? Street
Up where they walk, up where they run
Up where they stay all day in the sun
Wanderin' free
Wish I could be part of that world

What would I give if I could live outta these waters?
What would I pay to spend a day warm on the sand?
Betcha on land, they understand
Bet they don't reprimand their daughters
Bright young women, sick of swimmin', ready to stand

And ready to know what the people know
Ask 'em my questions and get some answers
What's a fire and why does it
What's the word? Burn
When's it my turn?
Wouldn't I love, love to explore that shore above?
Out of the sea
Wish I could be part of that world"

And she's a real sweet girl
And you know I got a boy
Details we both forgot to mention Forgot to mention)

And you...
I always know where you are
And you always know where I am
We're takin' it way too far
But I don't want it to end

This kiss is something I can't resist
Your lips are undeniable
This kiss is something I can't risk
Your heart is unreliable
Something so sentimental
You make so detrimental
And I wish it didn't feel like this
'Cause I don't wanna miss this kiss
I don't wanna miss this kiss
This kiss, this kiss, this kiss)
I don't wanna miss this kiss

This kiss, this kiss is something I can't resist
Your lips are undeniable
This kiss is something I can't risk
Your heart is unreliable
Something so sentimental
You make so detrimental
And I wish it didn't feel like this
'Cause I don't wanna miss this kiss
I don't wanna miss this kiss
I don't wanna miss this kiss

But if you ask me to, I couldn't, I couldn't, I
You lean in closer, and I shouldn't, I shouldn't, I
But if you ask me to, I couldn't, I couldn't, I
I shouldn't, I shouldn't
I don't wanna miss this kiss

I don't wanna miss this kiss
So detrimental
This kiss
I don't wanna miss this kiss

I wish it didn't feel like this
I don't wanna miss this kiss"
