SUGAR,Brockhampton,GINGER,"{'year': 2019, 'month': 8, 'day': 23}","Spendin' all my nights alone, waitin' for you to call me
You're the only one I want by my side when I fall asleep
Tell me what I'm waitin' for, tell me what I'm waitin' for
I know it's hard but we need each other
Know it's hard but we need each other

I move mountains on my own, don't need nobody help
Changed your mind when I changed my life, better start believin' in myself
And we all out lookin' for, lookin' for God so we never see it in ourself
Shit, divine intervention move in stealth
It's hard to tell what the prayer compelled
You can find me dancin' in between the raindrops
Tryna find a way to make the pain stop
Overtime, on the graveyard
Got a nigga feeling brainwashed
My instability's trademark
Copywritten in all my decisions
This is not supposed to be a way of livin'
Turned my temple down into a prison, shit

Spendin' all my nights alone, waitin' for you to call me
You're the only one I want by my side when I fall asleep
Tell me what I'm waitin' for, tell me what I'm waitin' for
I know it's hard but we need each other
Know it's hard but we need each other

Yeah, back on Vincent with the braces on
Used to slide out the back without the neighbors knowin'
Pose for the picture with the pearly whites
Dead lens zoomin' in, catchin' all my strikes
Used to trade Jordan for some molly
And she gave me all I need for the night, forties suffice
Morally alright, but I need some advice
And I know that I'm actin' foolish
Chris would pick me up around noonish
Half a blunt, yeah, we coolin'
Twist it up, puttin' on OutKast
Hunnid, Texas heat, and yeah, we cruisin'

But when I love you right, I love you right
All by yourself
But I'll make it bright, baby, I want you to know
I'ma be there for you, I'ma make you see that
I want you, I want you

Spendin' all my nights alone, waitin' for you to call me
You're the only one I want by my side when I fall asleep
Tell me what I'm waitin' for, tell me what I'm waitin' for
I know it's hard but we need each other
Know it's hard but we need each other
Back and forth
I'll take that if that's all you askin' for
With my legs up on the dashboard
Only thing in my pocket is my passport, papassport
Back and forth
I'll take that if that's all you askin' for
With my legs up on the dashboard
Only thing in my pocket is my passport, papassport
Back and forth
I'll take that if that's all you askin' for
With my legs up on the dashboard
Only thing in my pocket is my passport, papassport

So, do you love me, love me, love me?
Do you love me, love me, love me?
Do you love me, love me, love me?
Do you love me, love me? Oh
Do you love me, love me, love me?
Do you love me, love me, love me?
Do you love me, love me, love me?
Do you love me, love me? Oh"

Tell me why, tell me why
Who got the feelin'? Tell me why I cry when I feel it
Tell me why, tell me why Why?)

Phone ringin', never outgoin', homebody, never outgoin'
Put my doubts on when these walls up
Tearing at the black tie, finish addin' notches to my belt loop
They say help you, I can't help you
Why I can't speak out, it's wide out, wide out
Keep it deep inside my mind, it's offkilter, offkilter
I turn memory to fantasy, for that better pleasure for
Time machine gon' make it better, may be pitiful, yeah
I can't make this up, I can't take it back
Feel like a monster, feel like a deadhead zombie
Feelings you don't want me, I ain't givin' up, you should set it off
Tell me time's up, let the water run, let my body run

Tell me why, tell me why
Who got the feelin'? Tell me why I cry when I feel it
Tell me why, tell me why Why?)

Said she wanna get high off a nigga
I wanna die durin' sex or religion
God and pussy only know my intentions
Waking on the tour bus, then I'm sweepin'
You'd be hurtin' if you trust me, but you isn't
Honestly, that's probably the right decision
Pick up, listen if you wanna get rich
No sleep, how real bad man wake up

I found false hope in all kinda places
Hotel rooms and temporary feelings
I put my clothes on and try to check out
I try to hide from the sun, let it set now
Don't let God see me, I got a lot of demons
And I been sleepin' with 'em
And now I'm tangled in the sheets and sinkin' deeper with 'em
I'm going deeper in it, find me drownin' in it

They said, Do you make mistakes or do you make a change?""
Where do you draw the line for when it's better days?
You taste the wind for when it's cold enough to kill our flame
I wonder who's to blame
They ask me, Do you make mistakes or do you make a change?""
Where do you draw the line for when it's better days?
We taste the wind for when it's cold enough to kill our flame
I wonder who's to blame

Who got the feelin'? Tell me why I cry when I feel it

Everything I have Is a mirror)
And everywhere I stand Isn't solid ground)
People don't make sense To me anymore)
I'm hiding out, again, tryna figure it out, yeah
I'm tryna figure it out, uh
I'm tryna figure it out, yeah
I'm tryna figure it out
I forgot my passport for sure all for a pretty sky
I forgot my passport for sure all for a pretty sky
I forgot my passport for sure all for a pretty sky

Everything you wear, I'll be the one to care
Softly, you braid your hair, all the angels stare, yeah, oh yeah

Stripped down to my skin and my bones

In Tejas apartments with racists doin' weird shit
Like, this'll make the biopic Haha!)

Twistin' me up like licorice
Think I need someone who can handle it
Ice on my boys and my wrist is fixed
I don't need nobody tryna give me shit
Twistin' me up like licorice
Think I need someone who can handle it
Ice on my boys and my wrist is fixed
I don't need nobody tryna give me shit

The original licksplickety, higher than Yosemite
Breaking the mold mentally, master with no limiting
Making 'em say ugh!"", they worshipping our force viciously
Watching the floor tip in your temple of authenticity
Often they say Im off it, I offer my crossed empathy
They forgot what we on, Ill remind 'em with hostility
Hotdiggity damn, everyone running scams
Gotta cover your clams and take another glance
Running a clinic, no scans, ain't no one claimin' yo mans
It's all pertaining to plan, call me the architect
Lap you in a UFO, I haven't started yet
Still gotta figure out exactly where to park it at
Moses with the pen, each line an ocean I can part it at
But that's too deep

Don't call me stupid
That ain't the way my name pronounced
Don't call me Cupid
I got too many hoes right now
Poolside in Houston
Tryna see if Beyonc√© will take me for adoption
Brokeass rich suburbs
A civilian shot in rd Ward, we just by the fountain
This is Merlyn Wood, man
Everywhere I go is The Woodlands
I need a honeybutter
Vodka in a Sprite can
When I'm in the Whataburger
All the kids know who I am
I need a honeybutter
Pouring lean in my Sprite can
Twistin' me up like licorice
Think I need someone who can handle it
Ice on my boys and my wrist is fixed
I don't need nobody tryna give me shit
Twistin' me up like licorice

I don't need nobody tryna give me shit

I got a record but I'm clean as they come
I'm Godzilla, when they see me, they run
On th, used to run from the Bloods
The undercovers gotta duck when they come
I moved out and in a couple of months
I'ma be a pop star, they call me a thug
I used to write raps on the back of the bus
Now I'm in the front seat shifting the gears

It's funny how things can change
Three hundred dollars to my name led to Hollywood
I was living off ramen and change
Five hundred dollars on these dinners, never have to pay
Growing up my teachers told me
You better get them grades up if you wanna finish high school
And after high school, you better get a degree
'Cause it's a dogeatdog world, you could live in the street""
Flashback, I had my Walkman in the minivan
Listening to NSYNC, saw my name on the CD
Bleach blond tips, wanted to be JT
Wanted to do big things, had to fulfill a dream
One might say I was doomed from the getgo
But those same people assume, 'cause they'll never know
What it's like to be called to what's not set in stone
I am one with the ebb and flow, that's all I know
Twistin' me up like licorice
Think I need someone who can handle it
Ice on my boys and my wrist is fixed
I don't need nobody tryna give me shit
Twistin' me up like licorice
Think I need someone who can handle it
Ice on my boys and my wrist is fixed
I don't need nobody tryna give me shit
Twistin' me up like licorice

Ice on my boys and my wrist is fixed
I don't need nobody tryna give me shit
Twistin' me up like licorice

I spit my heart out, lookin' out for my best interests
He gave me good head, peepin' out while the windows tinted
I speak in tongues and I arrive without a damn mention
It's kinda sick, and I was born in  and
 the only year that I remember
I slip through the cracks without havin' a damn temper
I bleach my hair because these bitches all about they bitchin'
I say shit when I rap, and y'all niggas barely listen
I do the most for the culture, nigga, by just existing
Delete my tweets 'cause I'm ashamed of being a fuckin' Simpson
I told my mom I was gay, why the fuck she ain't listen?
I signed a pub' deal and her opinion fuckin' disappearin'
I'm payin' bills for my sister and tryna fund a business
Is it homophobic to only hook up with straight niggas?
You know, like, closet niggas, masctype?
Why don't you take that mask off?"" That's the thought I had last night
Why you always rap about bein' gay?""
'Cause not enough niggas rap and be gay
Where I come from, niggas get called faggot"" and killed
So I'ma get head from a nigga right here
And they can come and cut my head off, and
And my legs off, and
And I'ma still be a boss 'til my head gone, yeah

Break the wheel, pack the steel, hold my niggas down
Twistin' on that syrup til I hear crackin‚Äô sounds
Break the wheel, pack the steel, hold my niggas down
Twistin' on that syrup til I hear crackin‚Äô sounds

Twistin' on that syrup til I hear crack, crack, crack

Twistin' on that syrup til I hear crack

I don't trust nobody 'cause they don't deserve it
Niggas run in your house, they know you doin' dirty
Go 'head, now)
I got my hand on an ounce, and I got money servin'
I just bought me a fifth and now I'm speedin', swervin'
Go 'head, now)
I took an eighth of them shrooms, and now I'm hearin' voices
I took like two of them pills, I can't remember nothing
Go 'head, now)
I ain't under control, I'm losin' motor function
I need an intervention, I need an exorcism
I need a therapist, paranoia and drug addiction
It's very scary, my momma don't even recognize me
I'm goin' crazy, don't need nobody to say they love me
My acts of desperation, I'm on an empty stomach
So fuck the consequences, I ain't runnin' from them
Feelin' like a goner, put my life in locker
Hotbox in the Hummer
Hot bars in the summer Merlyn, Merlyn!)
If I had the option, I would do it all again
If I had the option, I would do it all again
I just wanna feel like I did the right program
I just want to appeal to my dad and my cousins Again)
When I cut the veal, I do not think 'bout diplomas
Love is knowin' that you didnt do it by your lonesome
So I forgive my mommy, daddy, auntie, and my uncles
For guilttripping feelings whenever they call my number
They see men dream, they see men fallin'
But when I dream, I'm smashing on a Lana

Both pessimistic, drug addicted, caught in our feelings
We spit venom then stare at the ceiling, wondering, why?""
My mom's no alcoholic, she just wanna drown her sorrows
Love her to death and soon enough, I'll give back all I borrowed
Both so submissive, take turns dominating, the light has been faded
This hatefueled love, we don't fake it, no givin', just takin'
I took some steps to be a bigger person
I should've thrown ya off the highway, the cars swerving
Ain't no burden, ain't no sermon, ain't no motherfuckin' plaque
I hate these hospitals and police and the smell of deathall that
I hate these shady folk that want it ladylike
But don't treat lady right, but they be sayin', like (Just the tip!"")
And yeah, you mad 'cause she ain't fuck, mad 'cause she ain't suck
Beat your ass before you got time to say Why not?""
Here to catch you slip up, wish you could just rewind
Time and not fuck up, thought you had just lucked up
Where the respect? Is your ass human?
I look you in your eyes, say, Fuck you, are you fuckin' stupid?""
Respect my mother, 'spect my sister, 'spect these women, boy
I get my -, I don't own one, hit the store to blow your brains off
Better hope my aim off, better hope the range off
Better hope my tame off before I blow your brains off, boy
Ugh, no hands with the stunts
Jump off the roof like I do what I want
All of my life in my past wanna haunt
And my sight of the future beginning to taunt my ambition
Man on the moon, I'm marooned, I ain't trippin', I'm on a mission
Every time that I speak, they ain't skippin'

She said she thought she felt my energy a country away
I apologized for not calling enough due to weight
But couldn't tell you if I kept it in my head to decay
I asked her, Why this world love echoing hate?""
She said, Don't let those who don't know you start dictating your fate""
I think the hardest part of love could be rebuilding the breaks
Conditioned to omit them until our foundation will shake
It's no debate
The road to peace is filled with snakes, you gotta keep your cool
And recognize the wolves that wanna try and leave you wool
Don't let 'em treat you like a window, you know you're a jewel
This world is cruel and not as simple as they teach in schools
Sometimes you gotta step away and check your own intentions
And analyze if what they do can compromise your vision
If people trust you, they don't need to question your decisions
You never needed them if they make you another villain

I lost my fucking mind and then I fell in love
I did a bunch of drugs because I couldn't sleep
I lost a couple months, I chipped my fucking teeth
And there's a couple women and they know some things
About lies that I done told and shit that I done said
And niggas that I robbed, so I'm real paranoid
I have voices in my head

Hi, my name is Merlyn, I just applied for food stamps
I just moved to California, with my boy band
Dropped out of a good school, hippies in my commune
I left 'fore the rent was due
Used to want a briefcase and a short commute
Used to wanna sell coke and whip an Audi coupe
Crazy, if I did that, wouldn't be talking to you
Walking through the pitfalls of a college student
Crazy how you get them letters and that make you feel accepted
'Til you walking 'round the campus and you the only African
Nobody with passion, just cats that take direction well
Take acid trips to find themselves, well...

I gotta get better at being me At being who I am)
I gotta get better at everything At being who I am)
I just want a friend that I can hang out with Being who I am)
Someone I can sit around, lay on my couch with Being who I am)

Ever since I moved out, I've been broke
Ever since I grew up, I've been ugly
Ooh, I need get me some dollar, dollar, dollar bills y'all
Ever since I left my momma house
I've been mad as hell at the world
Sometimes you don't gotta rhyme when you feel it
Sometimes I barely ever feel a fucking thing
Sometimes I wish that my fucking phone would fucking ring
And go off, and wake a nigga up
I'm used to being sad and I'm used to being down
I'm used to being used, I miss my boy being around

I gotta get better at being me At being who I am)
I gotta get better at everything At being who I am)
I just want a friend that I can hang out with Being who I am)
Someone I can sit around, lay on my couch with Being who I am)

Dropping all I got on this one day
I just wanna be somebody someday

I'm trying to look for motivation of smaller things
But baby steps to my atonement when I foster dreams
I've been told I'm too transparent with my thoughts sometimes
So I wrote songs until they pass and I can fall in line
I fell apart the moment that you thought you found yourself
'Cause I knew at that point, I couldn't be in the equation anymore
But moving on with open, broken hearts
Will show you everything you need to see about yourself to start moving forward
So many things I wanna say that I'm not sure need to be known
But everybody swears they fucking know me
So why, don't I lay every card I'm holding on the table?
At that point I wonder what they'd show me
I almost lost my father, still surreal for me to think about
Considering how many of my friends have lost theirs
I never know if what I'm saying is the right thing
If not, I'm ready more than ever for the crosshairs
It's all fair when it's not you
Some people have angels, what if only shadows follow you?
And all the ghosts inside that seem to hollow you
The branches of the weeping willow start to swallow you
And then you realize you're exactly where you're supposed to be
The horizon clears, you wipe the tears
And all the skeletons are ready for your story"

LOVE ME FOR LIFE,Brockhampton,GINGER,"{'year': 2019, 'month': 8, 'day': 23}","What I gotta do?
Keep it real with you
Stuck inside my truth
Spendin' all my loot
Diamond on my tooth
RIP. my brother Luk
When I spit, let it hit, hit a double U
Couple rainbows, my lil' halo
Think it's JLo, bro don't say so
Homie don't play, no
Takin' my day slow
Takin' my ray, throw
Talkin' to angels
Speedin' a pave' though
Changin' a page though
Lookin' like ace, talkin' 'bout spade, you are afraid though
Spendin' my queso
All on some fake clothes
When I change, never say, this is my blaze throat
South Central
All my homies know
If I could go, I would just wait though

Anyways, gotta go, disregard what I say
Grain of salt, sprinkle some over the shoulder, ayy
Lucky Strike, filterless, don't push me, 'kay?
Sensitive, abrasive, stab you in the face
Keep a blade, heaven sakes, had to raise the stakes
Dracula, in a cave, a bit lonely, mane
Grab a stake, have a cape, it don't work no more
Fly away, different ways, hit the liquor store
Better days, follow me like the saddest song
Grab a case, hideaway, fill my loads with bleach
Couple stains ain't a game, they both hauntin' me
Lot to say, people hate, wearin' blindfolds
Now where did I go? Where do we go?
How do we grow? How should I know?
Feel responsible, intolerable, displaced Uhhuh), insane

Piss 'em off, piss 'em off, piss 'em off
Shit, I better set it off
I just made a deposit, CDG in my closets
Fuel ain't really made of fossils
Dirt on me, I'm finna blossom
Spying on your ho from a SpaceX rocket
She wanna know why my wrist so rocky
Flash splash on me, photocopy
My weed, my weed at the party
Shoot me a sheriff for Trayvon Martin
King, Ali, and Bobby Marley
Dirt on me, I'm finna blossom
Dirt on me, I'm finna blossom
You know

I wish you'd love me for life
Love me for life, love me for life, wish you would lie
I wish you'd love me for life
Love me for life, love me for life, I will

Rain for a little bit, stay for a little bit
Moved along with my head down

Trippin' on my feet
As the distance between us
Became more than I can see

We had dreams, married Sunday
But I left Texas, now you hate me
In this town where I can't breathe
Yes, I love you, but I can't stay
And you ask why, but I can't say

Still ain't find all the answers
I don't want to be standard
Surgeries, I've been tampered
Watched her fight and beat cancer
Wasn't ready to let me go
I wasn't ready for life without
Fear one day that I'll make that call
I have to face all my darkest doubts
I can scream when I think of what happens for a reason
Find my ways to fly with everyone, I lost when I'm dreaming

Imagine me and you in a car crash
Imagine me and you shared a last laugh
Imagine me and you hold hands
Fake ass romantics
Like all the niggas we stanned
Think that's a classic, damn

I thank you for that

Why the hell do y'all keep reachin'?
In the evenings when I see em
I tell myself that love will be the thing to keep us from grieving
Need something new to believe in
'Cause these new niggas'll change on you
I mean they change on you
Why the hell the BBC only writes about me
When it comes down to controversy?
What about three CD's in one year with no label?
Then we signed and our story turned into a fucking fable

Now my mom call me whenever she need her car note

When I thought the automatic had an answer?
When I was jammin' out Beyonce like Sampha
And you broke up with me 'cause I'm a Cancer?

I need a reason to care about society
They need a good enough reason just to hire me

I should probably spend my time writing rhymes in the dentist's office
That's killing two birds in one stone
When I was younger, way before I was grown
I wanted a deal with Death Row or Rhymesayers
I'm saving my time for mics later
I might save it, depending on the shit that y'all write later

They hate truth, they hate peace; they want my niggas to burn with us

Engulfed by the manifestation of death behind me

And through the years I've dealt with tragedy after tragedy
God, send a message, send a messenger my way
Never claimed to be a saint, forgive me
Feel like the light that I was blessed with has diminished
I'm haunted by the visions of my youth turned true
I've come to expect my expectations aren't true
But I'm a master of believing my lies
And you can't break me, and I can't brake at the speed of light

Ego is getting sized up, I be on butterfly effect

Tell 'em they work for me now, tell 'em my tears, they bleed down
Tell 'em I work, like, what, what time for me now?
Wondering, Who is me?"" now, wondering where you been now
Lose you in crowds, I see now

Thinking of ways to be everything but right now
It's crazy how things feel the best when reminiscing
'Til we check ourselves
It's crazy how people who left say they feeling left out
When we step for health
Still accustomed to nights filled with solitude
I don't always remember to call goodnight
I don't always remember my altitude
I don't always remember to stop the fight
But I might check my sight, it ain't right

In between the clouds
Still love that sunshine

Remnants of my pops, put the Glock to his head
Nothing ever go as planned, couldn't make amends
Forcibly pretend I don't give a damn
At a loss, aimless, six feet deep
Suffocatin', can't face it
Can't change it, ain't make it
Master plans by the Maker, I see no savior
Morbid reflection and stainless steel, alcohol and pills
Deadly combinations left with nothin' else to feel

Places and my making, reflections off a broken mirror
Fragments of my fear glarin' back like, Who's there?""

Heard my mother squealin'
Master of disguises, ash to ash, dust to dust
Voids behind my eyelids, blackin' out, bleedin' out
Silence louder than a twisted tongue lying
As sick as our secrets
Shadow people and needles fading through a peephole
Bedtime stories from purgatory, I miss you

For the record, I can fly
Around the world absorbing light
Something's missing deep inside
The light

Only shot callers I was around was bartendin'

Take your shoes off, we just did the carpets in

I was standing on the bridge, I seen all y'all under me
Know you are struggling, niggas out here juggling
Losin' jobs and losing God, then everything is tumbling
Feel Heaven rumbling, the rapture is coming
I love the attention, I'm a bastard in public
I still struggle with tellin' my mom who I'm in love with
Subtleties in between, way these diamonds gleam
When Thanksgiving come around, I still don't see 'em
When Christmas come around, nigga, I still don't see 'em

Sometimes I'm watching my life
I'm dissociated from what eats my heart up at night
Sleep on a cloud of my strife

I'm just afraid of excitement being a trip to the mall

Got all these seasons within me, building a story to sing

Like I ain't grow up on MTV, Boondocks and The Chappelle Show
Bitch, I can handle the truth
That's how I entered the booth, look at all these bruises I got, it gave me so much confidence
Back when I was makin' songs at my mama's crib
The candle's lit, the temperature rising
What type of man can find the right time to fly in?
Especially when my cousin dyin'
Should've never sold my soul, should've protected all my opinions
To see the world move without you feel like a daydream
Koolaid stands, bandaids wrapped around your beautiful hands)
Protect me from the city
Couldn't save me from the world back then
Had Jeezy on repeat in your whip, no peace in my streets, and these days, no license
Only take the Jeep if my boyfriend is drivin'
Plus he got the kinda skin that make the police like him
Ever since I was a kid, I always felt so frightened
My mama from the ghetto
Her vote go to any nigga that keep Jesus in the convo
Me and her just get on good terms
Thank God for them unexpected turns
Breaks her heart when she see my city burn
Thank God for teachin' me how to learn to have empathy even when it burns

When that hammer pulled back, did you think of me?
You were the one that taught me how to be
Look at me now, in all my glory
Overcame a lot, that's a different story
Abandoned by the lifegiver
Looking back at my life different
Deep cuts in the dusk of the final gasp before your life flashed
What happens when you die? Does it fade black?
I sense you in my skin and the trucker cap
Miss it when we laughed
Didn't trust my intuition when I saw the cracks
I'm sorry, all I ever want to do is make you proud
Fleeting moments always found a way around the frown
Set aside the pain to celebrate the now
Couldn't kick me out the house, I was fucked up
Nothing to prove without doubt if I'm man enough
What's the use? I could use you, 'cause I'm scared as fuck
Tuck me in, always young enough to feel loved
And share some, are you lookin' down?
Inner child reachin' out, brittleboned, crying out
The past does not define you
The past does not define you
The burden was too much
Couldn't save you from yourself when you'd selfdestruct
Couldn't save me from myself when I'd push my luck
To tell the truth, I am just like you
Left it all in the pistol that you used
Always be your little man
Following your footsteps even though I'm mad
Even though you're gone, you live on

WHEN I BALL,Brockhampton,"ROADRUNNER: NEW LIGHT, NEW MACHINE (Physical Edition)","{'year': 2021, 'month': 4, 'day': 9}","
My mama said I didnt come into this world with tears
Instead, I welcomed her with open eyes and open ears
Became the glue to a few things that couldnt be repaired
We saw our future in each other, blending hope and fear
Some things you dont get to decide, its just a fate you share
I used to try to hold the weight that she would need to bear
Watched uncles going on vacation for a couple years
When th–µy came back they needed cloth–µs and had no souvenirs
I pick up the phone, theyre calling us from correction
But nothing is wrong, its filling my heart with questions
My mama is home, Im following her expressions
A drop in her tone, some things that she had to mention
I nodded, I listened, she had all of my attention
When you on your own, there gonna be some directions
I need you to follow and never make an exception""
I nodded; she held me and wished I would be protected

You always used to tell me
I can be anything I wanna be
But it's hard to see
It's hard to be
You always used to tell me
I can be anything I wanna be
But it's hard to see
It's hard to be with you

On my suckerfree shit since I was a fetus
Pullin‚Äô up at the doc in a Mazda 
Bet my dad was trippin‚Äô bad, hit the gas like carchase
Light blue in the back, mama gettin' labor pains
Dropped my sister at the Bulls' like house was twentythree
Sweat drippin' down my face like river runnin‚Äô free
Dark morning with the fog pourin‚Äô in and out the trees
Every movement through they eyes seem to zoom at lightspeed
Before me, she lost one, stillborn tragedy
Grittin‚Äô the teeth down to the root, pain like a cavity
Holdin' hands like they glued, radio channel on news
Valentines with a X"" up on the calendar
They knew I would be a fuckin‚Äô baller like them posters on the wall
A little stain could be the beauty in it all
Amidst all the trouble, most your luck was rubbin‚Äô off
Stickin‚Äô to you like mossyou my Kate, you my rock
Forever

You always used to tell me
I can be anything I wanna be
But it's hard to see
It's hard to be
You always used to tell me
I can be anything I wanna be
But its hard to see
It's hard to be with you
Here I go, I'm gonna spread my wings
All grown up, let go and look at me
You'll always be You'll always be)

Now I only yell at God and my therapist
Now I only yell at God, I lost my therapist
Right? Did I do that right?
Honestly, there were issues before ROADRUNNER
Iridescence, I wasn't really there for my brothers
Barely present, more focused on bad relationships
It was good for my image, I got lost in it
That's when I first started drinking, lost my hunger, man
When you make it, it feels like the longest summer, man
Went from wondering to struggling
Thank God, y'all was down to be patient, man
Ended up on so many different stages, man
Brought the whole family with us when we hit Japan
We gained a friend just to get used to losing 'em, feel like I lost a limb

I wish one of you niggas would just call me, man
We was an army, man, remember the plans we had?
Remember when rehearsals ain't go by so fast?
Remember when touring ain't revolve around cash?
But I can't even blame you 'cause my mama need the bag
And your daddy need the bag, this shit ain't gotta be so sad
I wouldn't take nothin' back even if I could rewrite the past

You ain't gotta talk you still blocked from my contacts

Space like a white girl but ride like a Lexus
Leather with an accent, designed by Italians
But he ain't got medallions, so maybe he a Mexican
But really what's the difference?

I don't know difference
Mirror black and white like a pilgrim
Plymouth landed on me like a kickflip
Y'all repress this, oppress this

I be going ham on Ray Street eating tofu
Loiter at the Whole Foods, sipping kombucha

Soy tu humilde servidor
Te presento mi necesidad de esperanza
Hay momentos en que me siento impotente
Hay momentos en que me siento d√©bil
Rezo por esperanza
Necesito esperanza para un futuro mejor
Necesito esperanza para una vida mejor
Necesito esperanza para amor y amabilidad
Algunos dicen que el cielo se hace m√°s oscuro justo antes de la luz
Rezo que esto sea cierto
Ya que todo parece oscuro
Necesito tu luz, se√±or, en cada sentido
Rezo para ser llenado con tu luz de cabeza a pies
Para disfrutar de tu gloria y saber que todo est√° bien en el mundo
Como has planeado, y como quieres que sea
Ay√∫dame a caminar en tu luz, y vivir mi vida en fe y gloria
En tu nombre rezo

You would never know
Where can you turn at the end of a road

I just drink and drive
The freeway eases my mind and I can cry on my own
Going , no one on the passenger's side
But the person in the rear view's telling lies

You could end it all if you'd like to
And you can drink a fifth and, uh
Drive to, um, wherever you'd like to

And nobody feels like you do
Plus, nobody understands the weight of the
Broken heart that you feel, so fuck it
You might as well just get real high and stupid
Rent a motel room and drink away your issues
It could be so simple, nobody wants to help you
They laugh and smile because you're different, you know
It's all your fault but you stay welltempered
You've always had your wits about you
You hide away, so mental
And I'm glad you stay reclusive
You have a wound that's selfinflicted
And in times like this it's too late to fix it
The weight of the world couldn't change you
And if you died, no one would miss you
So here's to another night alone with all your fears
And all your demons, your deepest darkest secrets
The shit that keeps you from sleeping
It's better when you don't think about it
But you don't have the power, 'cause I'm your master
Speed up and surrender, this time is different
So indecisive, no wonder why she left you
One of the many reasons why you'd like to
Put a bullet in your head or veer left off the highway
You're walking a tightrope at your lowest
Now you're hopeful, but that'll change when the night falls
You're a waste of a lifeform
You should do what you couldn't do this time last year
You can hope and pray all you want but nobody cares
Death waits for the time comes, and the time's come
Shut me up if you'd like to
But you're a coward and you know it's true
I'll be here if you need me, up to you

Packing up pills at the base apartment
I did a taste and thought it was garbage
Never had figured to ask who grabbed it
Noticed my friends had developed habits
Men and women both reduced to savage
Just to satisfy what needed scratching
MDMA mixed with bad karma
Spliffs from Newport's rolled with marijuana
Someone broke and sold the plug
Sent the law to his moms to put a slug on 'em

For instance, you have so much pain inside yourself, that you try and hurt yourself on the outside, because you want help, but it's the wrong help you're asking for.

And I remember sitting on the bottom of the pool with my eyes open, knowing that I couldn't get up. Knowing that I couldn't swim up.

What effect did the depression have on your marriage?""
Well, it gave everybody a wonderful new‚ÄÖlabel,‚ÄÖ'Diana's unstable and‚ÄÖDiana's mentally imbalanced', and unfortunately, that‚ÄÖseems to have stuck on over the years.""
Are you saying that label stuck within your marriage?""
I think people used it. And it stuck.""
According to press reports, it was suggested that it was around this time things became so difficult, that you actually tried to injure yourself. Is that true?""
Mhm. When no one's listening to you, or you feel like no one's listening to you, all sorts of things start to happen . For instance, you have so much pain inside yourself, that you try and hurt yourself on the outside, because you want help, but it's the wrong help you're asking for. People see it as crying wolf or attention seeking, and they think because you're in the media all the time, you've got enough attention, inverted commas, but I was actually crying because I wanted to get better.""

Sometimes I be mad that I ain't sexy
Sometimes I be shy to show my blessings
Poppin' like a carbonated beverage
The cops poppin' niggas Orville Redenbacher
Ian, you sexy!

Most times I give friends more time than family
You remember when I used to feel like I don't understand me
Now we speakin' the same language
I don't listen like I can be
But I'm learnin'
But I'm learnin'
But I'm learnin'

Sometimes I feel like I'm way too sexy
Most the singers found me in the desert
Minimi-, minimi-
Handle my business, don't talk to me directly
No one above me actin' like they all so lovely
Recogni-, Recogni-
They try to pin me down, they try to bind me
And they try to kill me like Anna Nicole
Heels switchin', finger clicking
Kick on me like Im James Bond on a role
They want the boot of my car
Pussy boy like booty call
Money quick like auctioneer
You need a neutral career
Look what we did in a year
Yeah! Yeah!
Oh, I'm lonesome, and hopeless
But hopeful, but hopeful
What's a boy to do lost in the world trying to find a balance
Sippin' out his chalice with its jewels dancing
Fluid like the potion
That pours when I get down some
Just trying to find a port in the sky where
The sun can shine down some
Jesus is lord, I put that on god
What more do you want from me?
He's in the dark, he's just a child
They turned their backs on me
Nevermind what it was
I see enemies
Don't want what's best for me
Best believe

I'm lonesome
But hopeful, But hopeful
I'm lonesome
But hopeful, But hopeful

'Times, it be so spot on it hurts
Like when auntie couldn't decide between going to work or church
I been in my feelings on that island in the dirt
I feel like brothers lie just so my feelings don't get hurt
I said I tried vacation, I tried to run away
I deleted Facebook, I'd trade fame any day
For a quiet texas place, and a BBQ plate
I'll switch my place if that's good for ya
Is that good for ya?
Good for ya
Is that good for ya?
Good for ya
