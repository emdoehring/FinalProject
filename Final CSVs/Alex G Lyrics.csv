Pretend,Alex G,High,"{'year': 2011, 'month': 1, 'day': 1}","Gonna crack a rib, when I get home
I'm gonna bury you in my favorite hole
I made a bloody mess in the kitchen sink
I tried to fix myself, but I didn't think

They said, We just want to talk with you""
We just want to walk you through,"" oh


Oh, I don't want to see me
I wanna be trapped in you
Oh, I don't want to be me
But I'm gonna pretend for you, oh


Let's paint our nails and keep it real
'Cause honey all I know is what I feel
I'm still looking for a friend of a friend
He said he'd hook me up, he told me what he had

They say, Leave your body, leave your mind
Don't you know you're out of time?""

In his room, in his bed
You can't hear what he said
Looks like dirt, tastes like trash
Honey, I know you could float right past
Oh, oh

Oh, I don't want to see me
I wanna be trapped in you
Oh, I don't want to be me
But I'm gonna pretend for you, oh"

I Wait for You,Alex G,EASY (EP),"{'year': 2011, 'month': 8, 'day': 21}","I have a friend who sits at the corner lots
Selling pills to the girls when they cross the block
I told him he should quit that sketchy scene
He said, Nothing compares to the fever dream""
It's what I do
I wait for you

I know a girl who stays still on Sunday night
Because her boy hits hard in the morning light
He told her, Everything ends when you reach that thrill""
He told her, Nothing exists past the window sill""
It's nothing new
I wait for you
I wait for you

I wanna tell my baby to pretend
That every word I say is what I really meant
And when I get my head back on all right
Then we can be together for another night
And we can have those dreams like no one else
It's just one more reason to control myself
Its just one more reason to control yourself
It's just one more reason to control myself

It's what I do
I wait for you
I wait for you
I wait for you
I wait for you
I wait for you"
Mary,Alex G,Trick,"{'year': 2012, 'month': 11, 'day': 2}","Mary is the girl that I wanna kiss
She's got big red eyes and big red lips
She's got big sharp teeth and big fat hips

Mary is the girl that I wanna fuck
She's got leather heart and leather gloves
She's the only girl that I wanna love
Listen to me, baby, I don't mind
I wanna be with you and waste my time

Give it to me, baby, I feel good
I wanna feel whatever you think I should

Do you know what Sarah meant
When she said, You be my guest""?
And keep the pace to save your face
You'll never make the place
Why do you even run the race?
I can't be what you need
I am stuck in a dream
I am stuck in a dream
Don't you know
She's been here all along in a dream?
She belongs in a dream
Every day I'll make promises that plague Sarah's heart
So I can watch her fall apart
'Cause I know when I break her down
We'll spit on all the happy clowns
That live around this sunny town
She loves me like a dog Doodoo)
And when we mess around Doodoo)
I'll let her know the truth I found Doodoo, doodoo)
In my own hopeless hate Doodoo)
And every time I wake Doodoo)
I second guess the game I played Doodoo)
Did I make a mistake?"
Gnaw,Alex G,Race,"{'year': 2010, 'month': 1, 'day': 1}","And you were cryin' loud, right out in the schoolyard
And, yeah, I felt good
Everything I knew was looking just as it should
I saw the tree
Carved in it """" and he found me
But I am no fool
I know every time I look in his eyes, he sees me too
Dry your eyes
I won't tell your mother

The things you kept under the covers
And please don't cry
I am not your brother
I am not your lover
And there is nothing wrong"
Hope,Alex G,House of Sugar,"{'year': 2019, 'month': 7, 'day': 15}","He was a good friend of mine
He died
Why I write about it now?
Gotta honor him somehow
Saw some people crying that night
Yeah, Fentanyl took a few lives from our life
Alright

I awoke in the middle of the night
He spoke
With his eyes half closed
Can you get me something else to eat?
Got a hole in my chest
I can't take it anymore
Put my pillow to the test
Let me rest


In the house they were calling out his name
All night
Taking turns on the bed
Throwing bottles from the windows of the home
On Hope Street
You can write a check in my name now
Eddie take the money and run"

If you want me to
I'd leave him for you
If you want me to
I'd leave him for you

Do you forget when we first met?
You grabbed my hand
I tore your dress
I felt things I cannot express
But I lost my way
I made my mess
I'd clean it for you
If you want me to
I'd clean it for you
If you want me to
I'd clean it for you
If you want me to
I'd clean it for you
If you want me to

But I know what you're doing
I know what you're doing
I know you
I know you
I do, I do, I tell you what

I paint pictures of my heart
The colors blue and purple start
To bleed into an endless dark
It's only you, it's only you

I'd burn them for you
If you want me to
I'd burn them for you
If you want me to
I'd burn them for you

I saw your friend's band play
A little show last night
It's not my thing, they were alright
You're in my dream last week
I'd like to hear what you think
We passed a house, driving fast
The sun was shining on the grass
You made me stop and leave the car
You pulled my sleeve but not too hard
Remember when you took too much?
I didn't mind being your crutch

We loved you then, it's not the same

Things to Do,Alex G,Race,"{'year': 2010, 'month': 1, 'day': 1}","Thinking of things to do
Yeah, only the cheapest things left there for you
And the only thing I learned from you
Is that there's nothing left to look forward to and
I was asleep for days
And now you're the only thing keeping me awake
The calculator will make the same mistakes
Yeah, I see it in its face

Hold on tight to this time, this place
'Cause everything you know will be erased
You were born inside your head
And that is where you'll be when you are dead
You're just a boy, you are no man
And nobody you know will understand
You're just a boy, you are no man
And nobody you know will understand

The game
Everyone
Wants to come
Along

Where you are

You're starting to look really weird, oh, yeah
Your face is out of place and I can't make you out

Its okay we dont cry, we love the southern sky
Its okay we dont cry, we love the southern sky

I'll tear out all your feathers
Cook you in the oven, burn myself
What is mommy cookin'?
She looks like a baby

Pull the trigger, love at first bite
Big plan for a big man
Tough change for a tough guy

Quiet is the closest thing we got"

When I'm stuck in bed
A little more than a memory
Sticks in my head

I really like the game we played
You left the CD here
A lot of positive messages
And something left unclear

Oh, I know, it's all in the Bible!)

Is it really endless?)
I mean, if you had a spaceship, could you go flyin' and flyin' through space forever?)"

But he was still a pretty close friend of mine
Maybe he had hurt me bad
But a brother is a brother and that is that

Mom's in a mood this week
'Cause she thinks that her family is going crazy
Guess it started with the baby
She went in for a hug, then it bit her on the cheek
That was pretty funny to me
But I guess I should have more sympathy
I never raised a kid
But I bet I'd do a good job if I did

Had a dream about a promised land
Walkin' 'round with a big gun in my hand
And when I look you in the eye
You're gonna tell me that you love me and hold me tight
'Cause you know that I have no fear
Ain't gonna walk into the river and disappear
I'm gonna be a powerful man

You want a pain that you don't feel

He'll make her bed a gravestone
And he'll dig til he can't think
Another awful thing
What she goes through
To be with you
You ought to give her the world
When she wakes up
She's in love with the thought
Of her boy
Never ending sick special toy
When she gets enough
She can't wait to show how tough
She can be
What she can teach you with her body

Baby I'll go down
For you

And they ask me why I'm so sad
That they feel bad for me
