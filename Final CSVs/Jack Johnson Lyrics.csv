Better Together,Jack Johnson,In Between Dreams,"{'year': 2005, 'month': 3, 'day': 1}","There's no combination of words I could put on the back of a postcard
No song that I could sing but I can try for your heart
Our dreams and they are made out of real things
Like a shoebox of photographs with sepiatoned loving
Love is the answer, at least for most of the questions in my heart
Like why are we here and where do we go, and how come it's so hard?
It's not always easy and sometimes life can be deceiving
I'll tell you one thing, it's always better when we're together

Mmm, it's always better when we're together
Yeah, we'll look at them stars and we're together
Well, it's always better when we're together
Yeah, it's always better when we're together

And all of these moments just might find their way into my dreams tonight
But I know that they'll be gone when the morning light sings
Or brings new things, for tomorrow night, you see
That they'll be gone too, too many things I have to do
But if all of these dreams might find their way into my day to day scene
I'd be under the impression I was somewhere in between
With only two, just me and you, not so many things we got to do
Or places we got to be, we'll sit beneath the mango tree now

Yeah, it's always better when we're together
Mmm, we're somewhere in between together
Well, it's always better when we're together
Yeah, it's always better when we're together

Mmmmmmmm, mmmmmm
Mmmmmmmm, mmmmmm

I believe in memories
They look so, so pretty when I sleep
And I when, and when I wake up
You look so pretty, sleeping next to me
But there is not enough time
And there is no, no song I could sing
And there is no combination of words I could say
But I will still tell you one thing
We're better together"
Banana Pancakes,Jack Johnson,In Between Dreams,"{'year': 2005, 'month': 3, 'day': 1}","Well, can't you see that it's just raining?
There ain't no need to go outside

But baby you hardly even notice
When I try to show you this
Song, it's meant to keep you
From doing what you're supposed to
Like waking up too early
Maybe we could sleep in
Make you banana pancakes
Pretend like it's the weekend now

And we could pretend it all the time
Can't you see that it's just raining?
There ain't no need to go outside

But just maybe
Hala ka ukulele
Mama made a baby
Really don't mind the practice
'Cause you're my little lady
Lady, lady, love me
'Cause I love to lay here lazy
We could close the curtains
Pretend like there's no world outside

And we could pretend it all the time
And can't you see that it's just raining?
There ain't no need to go outside

Ain't no need, ain't no need
Mmmmmmmmmmmm
Can't you see? Can't you see?
Rain all day and I don't mind

But the telephone singing, ringing, it's too early, don't pick it up
We don't need to
We got everything we need right here and everything we need is enough
Just so easy when
The whole world fits inside of your arms
Do we really need to pay attention to the alarm?
Wake up slow, mmmmmm, wake up slow

But baby
You hardly even notice
When I try to show you this
Song, it's meant to keep you
From doing what you're supposed to
Like waking up too early
Maybe we could sleep in
Make you banana pancakes
Pretend like it's the weekend now
And we could pretend it all the time
Can't you see that it's just raining?
There ain't no need to go outside

Ain't no need, ain't no need
Rain all day and I really, really, really don't mind
Can't you see? Can't you see?
We've got to wake up slow"
Upside Down,Jack Johnson,Sing-A-Longs and Lullabies for the Film Curious George,"{'year': 2006, 'month': 2, 'day': 24}","Who's to say
What's impossible? Well, they forgot
This world keeps spinning, and with each new day
I can feel a change in everything
And as the surface breaks, reflections fade
But in some ways, they remain the same
And as my mind begins to spread its wings
There's no stopping curiosity

I wanna turn the whole thing upside down
I'll find the things they say just can't be found
I'll share this love I find with everyone
We'll sing and dance to Mother Nature's songs
I don't want this feeling to go away

Who's to say
I can't do everything? Well, I can try
And as I roll along I begin to find
Things aren't always just what they seem

I wanna turn the whole thing upside down
I'll find the things they say just can't be found
I'll share this love I find with everyone
We'll sing and dance to Mother Nature's songs
This world keeps spinning

And there's no time to waste
Well, it all keeps spinning, spinning 'round and 'round
And upside down
Who's to say what's impossible and can't be found?
I don't want this feeling to go away

Please don't go away
Please don't go away
Please don't go away
Is this how it's supposed to be?
Is this how it's supposed to be?"
"Sitting, Waiting, Wishing",Jack Johnson,In Between Dreams,"{'year': 2005, 'month': 3, 'day': 25}","Well I was sitting, waiting, wishing
You believed in superstitions
Then maybe you'd see the signs
But Lord knows that this world is cruel
And I ain't the Lord, no I'm just a fool
Learning loving somebody don't make them love you

Must I always be waiting, waiting on you?
Must I always be playing, playing your fool?

I sang your songs, I danced your dance
I gave your friends all a chance
But putting up with them wasn't worth never having you
Ah, maybe you've been through this before
But it's my first time so please ignore
The next few lines 'cause they're directed at you

I can't always be waiting, waiting on you
I can't always be playing, playing your fool

I keep playing your part
But it's not my scene
Want this plot to twist
I've had enough mystery
Keep building it up
But then you're shooting me down
But I'm already down

Just wait a minute
Just sitting, waiting
Just wait a minute
Just sitting, waiting

Well if I was in your position
I'd put down all my ammunition
I'd wonder why'd it taken me so long
But lord knows that I'm not you
And if I was I wouldn't be so cruel
'Cause waiting on love ain't so easy to do

Must I always be waiting, waiting on you?
Must I always be playing, playing your fool?

No I can't always be waiting, waiting on you
I can't always be playing, playing your fool

Fool, hm hm"
Home,Jack Johnson,From Here to Now to You,"{'year': 2013, 'month': 9, 'day': 17}","I've got to get home there's a garden to tend
There's food on the ground and the birds have all moved back
Into my attic, whistling static when the young learn to fly
I will patch all the holes up again

Well, I can't believe that my lime tree is dead
I thought it was sleeping, I guess it got fed up with not being fed
And I would be too, I keep food in my belly
And hope that my time isn't soon, isn't soon

And so I tried to understand what I can't hold in my hand
And whatever I find, I'll find my way back to you
And if you could try to find it too
'Cause this place is overgrown, it's a waxing moon
Home is wherever we are, if there's love here too

In the back of our house there's a trail that won't end
We went walking so far, it grew back in
And there's no trail at all only grass growing taller
Get out my machete and battle with time once again
But I'm bound to lose 'cause I'll be down if time don't win

I've got to get home, there's a garden to tend
All the seeds from the fruits buried and began their
Own family trees, teach them, thank you and please
They spread their own roots, then watch their young fruit grow again
And this old trail will lead me right back to where it begins

And so I tried to understand what I can't hold in my hand
And whatever I find, I'll find my way back to you
And if you could try to find it too
'Cause this place is overgrown, it's a waxing moon
Home is wherever we are, if there's love here too
I said, home is wherever we are, if there's love here too
Well, home is wherever we are, if there's love here too"
Breakdown,Jack Johnson,In Between Dreams,"{'year': 2005, 'month': 3, 'day': 1}","I hope this old train breaks down
Then I could take a walk around
See what there is to see
Time is just a melody

With all the people in the street walking as fast as their feet can take 'em
I just roll through town
And though my window's got a view, well, the frame I'm looking through
Seems to have no concern for now, so for now I

I need this old train to break down
Oh, please, just let me please breakdown

Well, this engine screams out loud
Centipede gonna crawl westbound
So I don't even make a sound
Because it's gonna sting me when I leave this town

And all the people in the street that I'll never get to meet
If these tracks don't bend somehow
And I got no time that I got to get
To where I don't need to be, so I

I need this old train to break down
Oh, please, just let me please breakdown
I need this old train to break down
Oh, please, just let me please breakdown

I wanna break on down
But I can't stop now
Let me break on down

But you can't stop nothing if you got no control
Of the thoughts in your mind that you kept and you know
You don't know nothing, but you don't need to know
The wisdom's in the trees, not the glass windows
You can't stop wishing if you don't let go
The things that you find and you lose and you know
You keep on rolling, put the moment on hold
The frame's too bright, so put the blinds down low, and

I need this old train to break down
Oh, please, just let me please breakdown
I need this old train to break down
Oh, please, just let me please breakdown
I wanna break on down
But I can't stop now"
Do You Remember,Jack Johnson,In Between Dreams,"{'year': 2005, 'month': 3, 'day': 1}","Do you remember when we first met? I sure do
It was sometime in early September
Though you were lazy about it, you made me wait around
I was so crazy about you I didn't mind

So I was late for class, I locked my bike to yours
It wasn't hard to find, you painted flowers on it
I guess that I was afraid that if you rolled away
You might not roll back my direction real soon

Well I was crazy about you then and now the craziest thing of all
Is over ten years have gone by
And you're still mine, we're locked in time
Let's rewind

Do you remember when we first moved in together?
The piano took up the living room
You played me boogiewoogie, I played you love songs
You'd say we're playing house, now you still say we are

We built our getaway up in a tree we found
We felt so far away, but we were still in town
Now I remember watching that old tree burn down
I took a picture that I don't like to look at

Well, all these times, they come and go and alone don't seem so long
Over ten years have gone by
We can't rewind, we're locked in time
But you're still mine

Do you remember?"
Sunsets for Somebody Else,Jack Johnson,All the Light Above It Too,"{'year': 2017, 'month': 8, 'day': 3}","I know I've seen your face somewhere
Selling something, some big idea
I know I've seen that vacant stare
Selling sunsets for somebody else
You find yourself asking yourself
What is any of it worth?""
You find yourself looking up at night
From the bottom of the earth

And oh, can this world not afford to sleep anymore?
And oh, did your sheep start jumping?
They grow out their teeth, did they need a little something more
Than this?

The taste of trouble on your lips
'Cause now they're biting at your thoughts
You tell yourself just to turn away
But you know you've already lost
The smell of rain when its on the wind
Will never be paid in full
You try in vain to account for this mess
And everything that you stole

Ooo
And oh, can this world not afford to sleep anymore? Ooo)
And oh, did your sheep start jumping? Ooo)
They grow out their teeth, did they need a little something more
Than this?

'Cause now they're biting at your feet
They got you running from this place
Now they're breathing down your neck
Your eyes look lonely in your face
I see you looking just out of frame
What is it pulling you there?
'Cause things can never stay the same
So what is keeping you here?

Ooo
And oh, can this world not afford to sleep anymore? Ooo)
And oh, did your sheep start jumping? Ooo)
They grow out their teeth, they need a little something now

Every time you think, well, theyd be biting at your thoughts
And every time you blink, well, you'll be so damn far
But you want more
Than this
I know I've seen your face somewhere"
Bubble Toes,Jack Johnson,Brushfire Fairytales,"{'year': 2001, 'month': 1, 'day': 23}","It's as simple as something that nobody knows
That her eyes are as big as her bubbly toes
On the feet of the queen of the hearts of the cards
And her feet are all covered with tar balls and scars
It's as common as something that nobody knows
That her beauty will follow wherever she goes
Up the hill in the back of her house in the woods
Would she love me forever, I know she could

I remember when you and me, mmm, how we used to be
Just good friends, wouldn't give me none
But all I wanted was some

She's got a whole lot of reasons
She can't think of a single one
That can justify leaving
And he got none but he thinks he got so many problems
Man he got too much time to waste
His dreams are like commercials
But her dreams are picture perfect and
Our dreams are so related though they're often underestimated

It's as simple as something that nobody knows
That her eyes are as big as her bubbly toes
On the feet of the queen of the hearts of the cards
And her feet are all covered with tar balls and

La da da da da da
La da da da da da
La da da da da da
La da da da da da

Well I was eating lunch at the DLG
When this little girl came and she sat next to me
I've never seen nobody move the way she did
Well she did and she does and she'll do it again
When you move like a jellyfish rhythm doesn't mean nothing
You go with the flow, you don't stop
Move like a jellyfish, rhythm is nothing
You go with the flow, you don't stop

It's as common as something that nobody knows
That her beauty will follow wherever she goes
Up the hill in the back of her house in the woods
Would she love me forever, I know

She la da da da da da
La da da da da da
La da da da da da
La da da da da da
If you would only listen
You might just realize what you're missing
You're missing me
If you would only listen
You might just realize what you're missing
You're missing me

It's as simple as something that nobody knows
That her eyes are as big as her bubbly toes
On the feet of the queen of the hearts of the cards
And her feet are all covered with tar balls and

La da da da da da
La da da da da da

Angel,Jack Johnson,Sleep Through the Static,"{'year': 2008, 'month': 2, 'day': 5}","I've got an angel
She doesn't wear any wings
She wears a heart that can melt my own
She wears a smile that can make me want to sing
She gives me presents
With her presence alone
She gives me everything I could wish for
She gives me kisses on the lips just for coming home
She could make angels
I've seen it with my own eyes
You've got to be careful when you've got good love
Because the angels will just keep on multiplying
But you're so busy changing the world
Just one smile can change all of mine

We share the same soul
Oh oh oh oh oh ohh!
We share the same soul
Oh oh oh oh oh ohh!
We share the same soul
Oh oh oh oh oh ohh!
Oh oh oh oh oh ohh!
Mmmmm.."
My Mind Is for Sale,Jack Johnson,All the Light Above It Too,"{'year': 2017, 'month': 7, 'day': 14}","Well, I heard the blinker's on, I heard we're changing lanes
I heard he likes to race
I heard that six or seven words he likes to use
Are always in bad taste
And I heard that Monday's just a word we say
Every seven times around
And then we pin the tail on Tuesday
And watch those strings go up and down
The elephant in the room begins to dance, the cameras zoom into
His mouth begins to move
Those hateful words he uses

I don't care for your paranoid
Us against them walls
I don't care for your careless
Me first gimme gimme appetite at all

And all the real estate in my mind
Is for sale, it's all been subdivided
Divided into reasons why
My two opposing thoughts at once are fine
The residue from the price tag on the tip of my tongue
The words don't come, they go
How many likes I gotta get
Before I know the truth and the truth is
Season three will be a great reason
To forget all about
Reality's a slippery slope
Watch the TV scream and shout it

I don't care for your paranoid
Us against them fearful kind of walls
I don't care for your careless
Me first gimme gimme appetite at all


Now I heard the blinker's on, I heard we're changing lanes
I heard we need more space
I heard that six or seven words
Are in bad taste
It's absurd to believe that we might
Deserve anything, as if it's
Balanced in the end
And the good guys always win

I don't care for your paranoid
Us against them fearful kind of walls
I don't care for your careless
Me first gimme gimme appetite
With the residue from the price tag
On those two opposing thoughts in my mind
Us against them fearful kind of walls"
Good People,Jack Johnson,In Between Dreams,"{'year': 2005, 'month': 3, 'day': 1}","Oh you win, it's your show now
So what's it going to be?
'Cause people will tune in
How many train wrecks do we need to see
Before we lose touch, oh
And we thought this was low
Well it's bad, getting worse so...

Where'd all the good people go?
I've been changing channels
I don't see them on the TV shows
Where'd all the good people go?
We got heaps and heaps of what we sow

They got this and that with a rattle a tat
Testing, one, two, man whatcha gonna do
Bad news misused, got too much to lose
Give me some truth now, whose side are we on
Whatever you say
Turn on the boobtube, I'm in the mood to obey
So lead me astray
And by the way now...

Where'd all the good people go?
I've been changing channels
I don't see them on the TV shows
Where'd all the good people go?
We got heaps and heaps of what we sow

Sitting around feeling far away
So far away but I can feel the debris
Can you feel it?
You interrupt me from a friendly conversation
To tell me how great it's all going to be
You might notice some hesitation
Because it's important to you, it's not important to me
But way down by the edge of your whole reason
Well, it's beginning the show
And all I really want to know is...

Where'd all the good people go?
I've been changing channels
I don't see them on the TV shows
Where'd all the good people go?
We got heaps and heaps of what we sow
Where'd all the good people go?)
They got this and that with a rattle a tat
Testing, one, two, man whatcha gonna do
Bad news misused give me some truth
You got too much to lose
Now whose side are we on today, anyway
Where'd all the good people go?)
Okay, whatever you say
Wrong and resolute but in the mood to obey
Station to station desensitizing the nation
Where'd all the good people go?)
Going, going, gone"
Taylor,Jack Johnson,On and On,"{'year': 2003, 'month': 11, 'day': 3}","They say Taylor was a good girl, never one to be late
Complain, express ideas in her brain
Workin' on the night shift, passin' out the tickets
You're gonna have to pay her if you wanna park here
Well mommy's little dancer has quite a little secret
Workin' on the streets now, never gonna keep it
It's quite an imposition and now she's only wishin'
That she would have listened to the words they said
Poor Taylor

Well she just wanders around, unaffected by
The winter winds, yeah, and she'll pretend that
Well she's somewhere else so far and clear
About , miles from here

Well Peter Patrick pitterpatters on the window
But Sunny Silhouette won't let him in
And poor old Pete's got nothin' 'cause he's been fallin'
But somehow Sunny knows just where he's been
He thinks that singin' on a Sunday gonna save his soul
Now that Saturday's gone
Well sometimes he thinks that he's on his way
But I can see, that his brake lights are on

And he just wanders around unaffected by
The winter winds, yeah, and he'll pretend that
Well he's somewhere else so far and clear
About , miles from here

Such a tough enchilada, filled up with nada
Givin' what you gotta give to get a dollar bill
Used to be a limber chicken, time's abeen atickin'
Now she's finger lickin' to the man
With the money in his pocket, flyin' in his rocket
Only stoppin' by on his way to a better world

If Taylor finds a better world
Then Taylor's gonna run away"
Constellations,Jack Johnson,In Between Dreams,"{'year': 2005, 'month': 3, 'day': 1}","The light was leaving, in the west it was blue
The children's laughter sang
And skipping just like the stones they threw
Their voices echoed across the waves
It's getting late

It was just another night
With a sunset and a moonrise not so far behind
To give us just enough light to lay down underneath the stars
Listen to Papa's translations of the stories across the sky
We drew our own constellations

The west winds often last too long
And when they calm down nothing ever feels the same
Sheltered under the Kamani tree
Waiting for the passing rain
Clouds keep moving to uncover the sea
Of stars up above us chasing the day away
To find the stories that we sometimes need
Listen close enough, all else fades
Fades away

It was just another night
With a sunset and a moonrise not so far behind
To give us just enough light to lay down underneath the stars
Listen to all the translations of the stories across the sky
We drew our own constellations"
Never Know,Jack Johnson,In Between Dreams,"{'year': 2005, 'month': 3, 'day': 1}","Where the people keep on killing for their metaphors
But don't leave much up to the imagination
So I want to give this imagery back
But I know it just ain't so easy like that
So I turn the page
And read the story again and again and again

It sure seems the same
With a different name
We're breaking and rebuilding
And we're growing, always guessing

Never knowing
We're shocking but we're nothing
We're just moments
We're clever but we're clueless
We're just human
Amusing and confusing
We're trying
But where is this all leading?
We'll never know

It all happened so much
Faster than you can say disaster
Want to take a timelapse
And look at it backwards find the last word
And maybe that's just the answer
That we're afterBut after all
We're just a bubble in a boiling pot just
One breath in a chain of thought
We're moments just combusting
We feel certain but we'll never never know
It sure seems the same
Give it a different name
We're begging and we're needing
And we're trying and we're breathing

Never knowing
We're shocking but we're nothing
We're just moments
We're clever but we're clueless
We're just human
Amusing and confusing
We're helping
Rebuilding, never growing
Never know, if you never know, never know, never know

Knock knock, coming door to door
To tell you that their metaphor is better than yours
And you can either sink or swim
And things are looking pretty grim
If you don't believe in what they're spoonfeeding
It's got no feeling
So I read it again and again and again

It sure seems the same
So many different names
Our hearts are strong, our heads are weak
We'll always be competing

Never knowing
We're shocking but we're nothing
We're just moments
We're clever but we're clueless
We're just human
Amusing and confusing
But the true things
All we got is questions
We'll never know

Never know, never know, never know..."

No Other Way,Jack Johnson,In Between Dreams,"{'year': 2005, 'month': 3, 'day': 1}","When your mind is a mess, so is mine, I can't sleep
'Cause it hurts when I think my thoughts aren't at peace
With the plans that we make, the chances we take
They're not yours, they're not mine
There's waves that can break
All the words that we said and the words that we mean
Words can fall short, can't see the unseen
'Cause the world is awake for somebody's sake
Now please close your eyes
Woman, please get some sleep

And know that if I knew all of the answers
I would not hold them from you
Know all of the things that I know
We told each other there is no other way

Too much silence can be misleading
You're drifting, I can hear it in the way that you're breathing
We don't really need to find reason
'Cause out the same door that it came well it's leaving, it's leaving
Leaving like a day that's done and part of a season
Resolve is just a concept that's as dead as the leaves
But at least we could sleep, it's all that we need
When we wake we would find, our minds would be free
To go to sleep

And know that if I knew all of the answers
I would not hold them from you
Know all of the things that I know
'Cause we told each other there is no other way"
Gone,Jack Johnson,On and On,"{'year': 2003, 'month': 5, 'day': 6}","One, two)

Well look at all those fancy clothes
But these could keep us warm just like those
And what about your soul? Is it cold? Is it
Straight from the mold and ready to be sold?
And cars and phones and diamond rings
Bling, bling, but those are only removable things
And what about your mind? Does it shine? Are
Are there things that concern you more than your time?

Gone, goin', gone, everything, gone, give a damn
Gone be the birds, when they don't wanna sing
Gone, people, all awkward with their things
Gone

Look at you, out to make a deal
You try to be appealing, but you lose your peel
And what about those shoes you're in today?
They'll do no good on the bridges you burnt along the way, oh
You willing to sell anything? Gone, with your herd
Leave your footprints, we'll shame them with our words
Gone, people, all careless and consumed, gone

Gone, goin', gone, everything, gone, give a damn
Gone be the birds, if they don't wanna sing
Gone, people, all awkward with their things
Gone"
Love Song #16,Jack Johnson,All the Light Above It Too,"{'year': 2017, 'month': 9, 'day': 8}","When you were a little girl
And you were an ocean away from me
Didn't know what I wanted yet
But you were already listening to The Pixies

And we were a little shy
And you were still an arm's length away from me
Didn't know what I wanted yet
But you were already reading beat poetry

And we were a little free
When we were seven seas away from anything
Finally knew what I wanted then
But you were already my best friend
Yeah, you had already become my best friend

When you were teaching geometry
And we were both living off of your salary
I wanna thank you for not kicking me out
I wanna thank you for letting me live in our house
I wanna thank you for letting me live in our house

Finally we made a family
Make a little home then
Fill it up with children
Never mind the rest, it's all just
Irrelevant if we're just stardust
This dusty old world won't rest and
These dusty little kids keep stretching high
Just like the tide

When you were a little middleaged like me
And we were already  love songs deep
You give me too much love, so I blame you
Well, here's another love song for you
You give me too much love, what can I do?
Well, here's another love song for you
Just another love song for you"
I Got You,Jack Johnson,From Here to Now to You,"{'year': 2013, 'month': 6, 'day': 9}","Back when all my little goals seemed so important

I got everything, I've got you
I don't need nothing more than you
I got everything, I've got you

Maybe if we save up we could build a little home
But then the hailstorm came, it yelled
You need to let go, you got no control"", no

I got you
I got everything, I've got you
I don't need nothing more than you
I got everything, I've got you

Some days I can't hold it at all

If I Could,Jack Johnson,In Between Dreams,"{'year': 2005, 'month': 3, 'day': 1}","A brand new baby was born yesterday, just in time
Papa cried, baby cried, said your tears are like mine
I heard some words from a friend on the phone, didn't sound so good
The doctors gave him two weeks to live, I'd give him more if I could

You know that I would now
If only I could
You know that I would now
If only I could

Down the middle drops one more grain of sand
They say that new life makes losing life easier to understand
Words are kind they help ease the mind
I'll miss my old friend
And though you've got to go we'll keep a piece of your soul
One goes out, one comes in

You know that I would now
If only I could
You know that I would now
If only I could"

He became a prisoner of his own past
He stabbed the moment in the back with the round thumbtack
That held up the list of things he got to do
It's really no good
He's moving on before he understood
He shot the future in the foot with every step he took
Caught from the places that he did 'cause he forgot to look

He better staple it together and call it bad weather
Staple it together and call it bad weather
Staple it together and call it bad weather
Staple it together and call it bad weather, mmmmm

Well I guess you could say
That he don't even know where to begin
'Cause he looked both ways but he was so afraid
Digging deep into the ditch, every chance he missed
And the mess he made
'Cause hate is such a strong word
And every brick he laid, a mistake they say
That his walls are getting taller, and his world is getting smaller

Better staple it together and call it bad weather

Spend a little time or we could do whatever
And if we get together we'd be twice as clever

Nothing to prove or to assume
Just thinking that your thoughts are different than mine

To a place that I can't be, but there's no apologies

Just go on

There's still so many things I wanna say to you

Just go on

From the moment that we start
From the moment that we start

On the surface of the ocean, out the window of a plane
I get nervous when I fly, I'm used to walking with my feet
Turbulence is like a sigh that I can't help but overthink
What is the purpose of my life if it doesn't have to do
With learning to let it go? Live vicariously through?
You could do the same, it's the least you could do
'Cause it's a lonely little chain if you don't add to it

So go on

Back to school, ring the bell
Brand new shoes, walking blues
Climb the fence, books and pens

Yes, I can tell that we are going to be friends
Walk with me, Suzy Lee
Through the park and by the tree
We can rest upon the ground
And look at all the bugs we've found
Safely walk to school without a sound
We safely walk to school without a sound
Well, here we are no one else
We walk to school all by ourselves
There's dirt on our uniforms
From chasing all the ants and worms
We clean up and now it's time to learn
We clean up and now it's time to learn
Numbers, letters, learn to spell
Nouns and books and show and tell
Play time, we will throw the ball
Then back to school class the hall
The teacher marks our height against the wall
The teacher marks our height against the wall
And we don't notice any time pass
Because we don't notice anything
We sit side by side in every class
The teacher thinks that I sound funny
But she likes it when you sing
Tonight I'll dream while in my bed
While silly thoughts run through my head
Of the bugs and alphabet
And when I wake tomorrow I'll bet
You and I will walk together again

Watch you change the frame or
Watch you when you take your aim at the sum
Of everything

But you and your heart
Shouldn't feel so far apart
You can choose what you take
Why you got to break and make it feel so hard

You lay there in the street
Like broken glass reflecting pieces of the sun
But you're not the flame
You got the people passing by
Because you know what you don't like
It's just so easy, it's just so easy

But you and your heart
Shouldn't feel so far apart
You can choose what you take
Why you got to break and make it feel so hard
Oh, and you and your heart
Shouldn't feel so far apart
You can choose what you take
Why you gotta break and make it feel so hard?

You draw so many lines in the sand
Lost the fingernails on your hands
How you going to scratch any backs?
Better hope the tide will take our lines away
Take all our lines and
Hope the tide will take our lines and
Hope the tide will take our lines away
Take all our lines away"
All at Once,Jack Johnson,Sleep Through the Static,"{'year': 2008, 'month': 2, 'day': 5}","All at once
The world can overwhelm me
There's almost nothing that you could tell me
That could ease my mind
Which way will you run
When it's always all around you
And the feeling lost and found you again
A feeling that we have no control
Around the sun
Some say
There's going to be the new hell
Some say
It's still too early to tell
Some say
It really is no myth at all
Keep asking ourselves are we really
Strong enough
There's so many things that we got
Too proud of
We're too proud of
We're too proud of
I want to take the preconceived
Out from underneath your feet
We could shake it off
Instead we'll plant some seeds
We'll watch them as they grow
And with each new beat
From your heart the roots grow deeper
The branches will they reach for what
Nobody really knows
But underneath it all
There's this heart all alone

What about when it's gone
And it really won't be so long
Sometimes it feels like a heart is no place to be singing from at all

There's a world we've never seen
There's still hope between the dreams
The weight of it all
Could blow away with a breeze
If you're waiting on the wind
Don't forget to breathe
Cause as the darkness gets deeper
We'll be sinking as we reach for love
At least something we could hold
But I'll reach to you from where time just can't go

Won't you guide my sleigh tonight?""

As they shouted out with glee

Fading faster and faster until it was gone

Was only worth nickels and dimes

If you're not into yoga, if you have halfabrain
If you like making love at midnight, in the dunes of the cape
Then I'm the love that you've looked for, write to me, and escape.""
I didn't think about my lady, I know that sounds kind of mean
But me and my old lady
Had fallen into the same old dull routine
So I wrote to the paper, Took out a personal ad
And though I'm nobody's poet, I thought it wasn't halfbad
Yes, I like Piña Coladas, and getting caught in the rain
I'm not much into health food, but I am into champagne
I've got to meet you by tomorrow
And cut through all this red tape
At a bar called Scrappy Malloy's, we'll plan our escape.""
So I waited with high hopes, then she walked in the place
I knew her smile in an instant, I knew the curve of her face
It was my own lovely lady, and she said, Oh, it's you.""
And we laughed for a moment, and I said, I never knew,""

To rebound off of we

Well dust off your thinking caps

Pretty pictures of things we ate
We are only what we hate
But in the long run we have found
Silent films are full of sound
Inaudibly free

Slow down everyone
You're moving too fast
Frames can't catch you when
You're moving like that

Inaudible melodies
Serve narrational strategies
Unobtrusive tones
Help to notice nothing but the zone
Of visual relevancy
Framelines tell me what to see
Chopping like an axe
Or maybe Eisenstein should just relax

Slow down everyone
You're moving too fast
Frames can't catch you when
You're moving like that

Demanding refunds for the things they've seen

In all the things that never made the screen

We're burning under control

Burning under the same sun?
Buy now and save, it's a war for peace
It's the same old game

We could say it's us against them
We could try but nobody wins

Could try to put it out

Using fear as fuel
Burning down our name
And it won't take too long
'Cause words all burn the same
And who we're gonna blame now in all?

It's such a crying, crying, crying shame
It's such a crying, crying, crying shame, shame, shame

By now it's beginning to show
A number of people are numbers that ain't coming home
I could close my eyes it's still there
Close my mind be alone
I could close my heart and not care
But gravity has got a hold on us all
It's a terrific price to pay
But in the true sense of the word
Are we using what we've learned?
In the true sense of the word
Are we losing what we were?

Will it ever stop?

The shots of tequila, man they'll say that they need ya

Her dreams of belly button rings and other kinds of things
Symbolic of change but the thing that is strange
Is that the changes occurred, and now she's just a part of the herd

Not dead but definitely dyin'

Next to you, the central coast
The central thought within my mind
Is how to stay within these lines
But still be free
Beneath the ground the giants sleep
And maybe we're just in their dreams
The setting sun with every turn
Above the ground the oak trees burn
And they weep, for rain

And for this endless conversation
Instigated by the stars

A pocket knife, an old guitar
Coffee cup, a deck of cards
Corre, corre, dashboard feet
Flashlight children by the stream
A box of books, a book of rocks
One for the birds, one for the knots
That I will learn how to tie
Around this day to keep my life
From sliding away

From this endless conversation
Instigated by the stars
A little wood to keep it burning
Facinated by it all

The first awake will stoke the coals
The early morning river roads
The last one in the swing will break
Stones will stake the kids will make
Those lines
Rocks and boxing by the creek
Again, the lines begin to speak
Words are broken, smoke signals
That will lead us into the light
Into it all, and always

Always endless conversations
Implicated by the stars
A little wood to keep it burning
Facinated by it all
And always"

The kids are laughing in their sleep
Swimming through their dreams into the morning
So peaceful all the stories that we're told
Lead them through the night back from the shadows
So much joy every little girl and boy
Even better when they wake up tomorrow
So much love
In their little mistletee
Going to miss you until we meet again in the morning
So much peace in their pitterpatter feet
Any open eyes can see that minds are reaching
So much joy
I'm afraid to be swept away
Upstream there's a spring that brings in the new day
These are the gifts we keep
And this is the morning that we breathe
And then we see
These moments are the only gifts we need
And your crazy curly morning hair
Your maka piapia stare
Smiling down from the top of the stairs
You're so sweet
And your robot pictures spread around
I swear your feet don't touch the ground
Once it starts it don't slow down
But I don't want it to

And these are the gifts we keep
And this is the morning that we breathe
And then we see
These moments are the only gifts we need"

Your thoughts were afraid of
Secrets that we keep
The surface of our love and hate

Why can't we relate
With ourselves with what we open
Up when it's too late?

What we used to be
What we will become
Words we cannot see
Breaking up by one, by one

Slowly we fell under a spell
One by one
Slowly we wake up

Fragments of a scene
From a distance they jumped down
Little time machines
Messages of love and hate

I slowly bend 'til I see the back of my own sins
I stole my soul from myself, now I wonder
Wonder, is there somebody with a perfect plan
That goes boom when it's stamped and we could understand
How the gods of old used to clap their hands to make thunder
So we're clapping and we're laughing like it was so absurd
In the future we'll be laughing at who we were right now
As man plays god with the land that he plunders
To the one unknown no one can know nor see
That's resistant to greed, if we listen to
Time after time, time can never go under

There's this vine trying to climb
Through the window into my life
I don't mind, I don't mind
I don't mind
There's this wine trying to find
Its way from the bottle into my mind
In my mind, in my mind
In my mind

And so this vine is trying to climb through the window into my life
To bring me symmetry and memories of a backlit breeze
Back into a dream on the ground, lookin' up at the sun coming down
Into a world of boys and girls are holding handheld devices
While they're eating and they're sleeping and they're dreaming of the prices
We'll be paying down the line, when the ice melts maybe it will turn to wine
And all the greatest of the heroes started jumping from the books
They started wearing ones and zeros, looking more and more like crooks
They stole the sunlight from the future, took a sip, drained half the glass, and put it back
And a lot of people like to have a feast, not so many could stomach the killing
Lot of traffic on the streets, so who's really doing all the drilling
Keep on filling what can never be full
My imagination has got a hold on me

There's this vine trying to climb
Through the window into my life
I don't mind, I don't mind
I don't mind
There's this wine trying to find
Its way from the bottle into my mind

Monsoon,Jack Johnson,Sleep Through the Static,"{'year': 2008, 'month': 2, 'day': 5}","I feel sorrow for the fear
And everything it brings
Wonder if it will ever sleep
I know you understand
Because you briefly look away
Focusing on nothing
So now everything is clear
Because there's no one to blame
You got no place to hide
It's only in your mind
And I saw you in amazement
Stumbling through the day
You told me time never waits
What is that supposed to mean?

All of life
Is in one drop of the ocean
Waiting to go home
Just waiting to go home
And if the moon
Can turn the tides it can pull the tears
And take them from our eyes
And make them into monsoons

And turn them into monsooner or later
They'll weave their way back to the sea
Going to finally be free
Yeah, free for a while
Until they break
Like waves of sorrow
Always do, all into time
Because time never waits

Daddy don't daydream again
Just help me to believe and then
Show me that there's more than the meantime
Sonny, do you hear the sound?
You will feel it when it breaks
You will know it when its gone
How else can I explain?
Because it's only the pain
It's coming straight through
Come into a mind
Cross cut to you in amazement
Stumbling through the day
You tell me that time never waits
That's okay because I don't wait for time
When all of life
Is in one drop of the ocean
Waiting to go home
Just waiting to go home
And if the moon
Can turn the tides it can pull the tears
And take them from our eyes
And turn them into monsoons

She wears a heart that could melt my own
She wears a smile that could make me want to sing

She gives me presents
With her presence alone
She gives me everything i could wish for
She gives me kisses on the lips just for coming home

She can make angels
I've seen it with my own eyes
You got to be careful when you you've got good love
'cause them angels will just keep on multiplying

But you're so busy changing the world
Just one smile and you could change all of mine

No song that I could sing but I can try for your heart

Why are we here?"" and Where do we go?""
And How come it's so hard?""

Yeah we'll look at them stars when we're together
Well it's always better when we're together
Yeah it's always better when we're together

And all of these moments
Just might find their way into my dreams tonight
But I know that they'll be gone when the morning light sings
Or brings new things for tomorrow night you see
That they'll be gone too too many things I have to do
But if all of these dreams
Might find their way into my daytoday scene
I'd be under the impression I was somewhere in between
With only two just me and you not so many things we got to do
Or places we got to be we'll sit beneath the mango tree now
Yeah it's always better when we're together
Mmm we're somewhere in between together
Well it's always better when we're together
Yeah it's always better when we're together

I believe in memories they look so so pretty when I sleep
And when I wake up you look so pretty sleeping next to me
But there is not enough time and there is no no song I could sing
And there is no combination of words I could say
But I will still tell you one thing we're better together"

How many years and you've barely even tasted

Incoming tide touches roots to expose them

Moving south, the engine running smooth
Officials were quite friendly once we drowned them with our sweet talk
And we bribed them with our cigarettes and booze

So I took it apart built a billion boxes
There was only one key

Don’t Believe a Thing I Say,Jack Johnson,From Here to Now to You,"{'year': 2013, 'month': 9, 'day': 17}","Mercury's in retrograde
Don't believe a thing I say
You know I don't believe that stuff
My mind's only made of dust
The echo always said get real
Mostly I just go by feel
Kick it first if it don't start
Don't need tools, I got my heart

Are we free or afraid of what we're told?
Are we out of or under control?

When Saturn returns I begin
To trust in patterns more than men
Or the stories that they tell
Even when they tell them well
The echo always sounded good
Until I finally understood
I only had to open the door
Now I don't trust the echo anymore

Are we free or afraid of what we're told?
Are we out of or under control?

All these planets pulling me around
They pulled my face into a frown
Even though my mind's made up
My mind's only made of dust
From stars and clouds and oceans all unseen
From stars and clouds and oceans all unseen

Are we free or afraid of what we're told?
Are we out of or under control?"
The Horizon Has Been Defeated,Jack Johnson,On and On,"{'year': 2003, 'month': 5, 'day': 6}","The horizon has been defeated by the pirates of the new age
Alien casinos, well, maybe it's just time to say
That things can go bad and make you wanna run away
But as we grow older, the trouble just seems to stay

Future complications in the strings between the cans
But no prints can come from fingers if machines become our hands
And then our feet become the wheels, and then the wheels become the cars
And then the rigs begin to drill, until the drillin' goes too far

Things can go bad and make you wanna run away
But as we grow older, the horizon begins to
Fade, fade, fade
Fade away

But thingamajigsaw puzzled, anger, don't you step too close
Because people are lonely and only animals with fancy shoes
And hallelujah zigzag nothin', misery, it's on the loose
Because people are lonely and only animals with too many tools
That can build all the junk that we sell
Ah, sometime, man, make you want to yell

That things can go bad and make you wanna run away
But as we grow older, the horizon begins to
Fade away
Fade away

Fade, fade, fade
Fade, fade, fade"
Losing Hope,Jack Johnson,Brushfire Fairytales,"{'year': 2001, 'month': 1, 'day': 23}","I got a faulty parachute, I got a stranger's friend
An exciting change in my butcher's blend
A symbol on the ceiling with the flick of a switch
Yeah, my newfound hero in the enemy's ditching

Well somebody's something was left in the room
And man, now that its gone, well, of course we assume
That somebody else needed something so bad
That they took everything that somebody had

Losing hope is easy
When your only friend is gone
And every time you look around
Well, it all, it all just seems to change

The mark was left, man, it's never the same
Next time that you shoot, make sure that you aim
Open windows with passing cars
A brand new night with the same old stars

Losing hope is easy
When your only friend is gone
And every time you look around
Well, it all, it all just seems to change

Feed the fool
A piece of the pie
Make a fool of his system
Make a fool of his mind
Give him bottles of lies
And maybe he'll find
His place in heaven
Because he might just die

Losing hope is easy
When your only friend is gone
And every time you look around
Well, it all, it all just seems to change

But hanging on is easy
When you've got a friend to call
When nothing's making sense at all
You're not the only one that's afraid of change"

Well he's not necessarily trying to say god can't be trusted
But someone plays evil tricks on that kid
And certain situations scream for deviations
But somehow he always gets stuck in the middle
Of this and that and man he should try less
Because every time he's rejected, man, he loses affection

But don't we all, don't we just got to give a little time
Maybe give a friend a call instead of making him confused
What a terrible thing for you to do
What an awful thing for you to say
What a terrible thing for you to relay

Well I know some people's they got a little less than nothing
But still find some to spare
And other people got more than they could use
But they don't share
And some people got problems man
They got awful complications
Other people got perfect situations
With no provocation

But don't we all, don't we just got to give a little time
Maybe give a friend a call instead of making him confused
What a terrible thing for you to do
What an awful thing for you to say
What a terrible thing for you... Confused

What a terrible thing for you to relay

No it won't seem like anytime that I've been gone
It ain't the first time, it won't be the last
Won't you remember these words to help the time pass?

One day these could be the days but who could have known
Loading in the back of a pickup truck
Riding with the boys and pushing the luck
Singing songs loud on the way to the game
Wishing all the things could still be the same
Chinese homeruns over the backstop
Kakua on the ball and soda pop well

We used to laugh a lot
But only because we thought
That everything good always would remain

Nothing's going to change, there's no need to complain

Sunday morning and it's time to go
Been raining all night so everybody knows
Over to the field for tackle football
Big hits, big hats, yeah give me the ball
Rain is pouring, touchdown scoring
Keep on rolling, never boring
Karma, karma, karma chameleon
We're talking kinda funny from helium

We used to laugh a lot
But only because we thought
That everything good always would remain

Nothing's going to change, there's no need to complain

Monday morning and it's time to go
Wet trunks and schoolbooks and sand on my toes
Do anything you can to dodge the busstop blues
Like driving a padiddle with a burntout fuse
Well my best friend Kimi wants to go with you
So meet her by the sugar mill after school
My best friend Kimi wants to go with you
Meet her by the sugar mill after school

Open Mind,Jack Johnson,Meet the Moonlight,"{'year': 2022, 'month': 6, 'day': 24}","Why is it so hard to find an open mind?
I'm finding it so hard to keep an open mind
I open up the windows, there's a storm inside
Let the wind blow in and the rain wash away the
Shiny little things, trying to find a way into mine
Some nights I can fall for hope, but some I can't sleep
And sometimes I can forget that it's falling to pieces

And why we find it so easy to believe
In everything we're sold, but we're never going to see?
And everything around us is begging just to be
Loved a little more, we can pray to anything
You want, you need, anything you want

An open mind stuck between hope and doubt
Don't try to make sense of it, it don't work out
Sharpen all our senses 'til we can't see the light
Juryrig ambitions 'til they come back at nighttime, knocking
Let me in, let me go

And why we find it so easy to believe
In everything we're sold, but we're never going to see?
And everything around us is begging just to be
Loved a little more, we can pray to anything
We want, we need, anything we want

All of time in this one single day

As I Was Saying,Jack Johnson,From Here to Now to You,"{'year': 2013, 'month': 9, 'day': 17}","As I was saying
Just before you left the room before
Before I assumed that you might not
Come around
As I was saying
Just after I took my foot from
My mouth and put it back
On the ground

Well I don't want to disappoint you
And I don't want to disappear
From here or now or you

This is worth saving
'Cause the sum of us is more than us
If you add us up then subtract
My lack of sleep
'Cause my mind feels crazy
When all these thoughts come rushing in
Should I be trusting them or
Only let them be?

'Cause I don't want to disappoint you
And I don't want to disappear
From here or now or you

Is it just a matter of time?
Does it even matter at all?
'Cause even if this story should fall from the sky to the sea
If I should fall, would you fall down with me?
Would you fall with me?

Found my foundation
It was underneath me all alone
On this path I'm on, now I
Never walk alone
And I've been erasing
Rewrote the second half like this
So my protagonist might find
His way back home

And I don't want to disappoint you
I don't want to disappear
From here or now or you
No, not from here or now or you"

When I Look Up,Jack Johnson,To the Sea,"{'year': 2010, 'month': 6, 'day': 1}","When I look up
At the stars as I walk
In the night down the street
By my house, it feels good
When I look up
At the stars as I walk
In the night down the street
By my house, it feels good
The light from the moon
Is afraid of the ground
So it falls behind spaces
And hides behind clouds
When I look up
At the clouds as they move
Through the night with the wind
As I walk down the street
The light from the moon
Is afraid of the ground
So I step on the shadows
Of my own feet"

So I remember every face
Of every man who put me here
I see my light come shining
From the west down to the east
Any day now, any day now
I shall be released
They say every man who needs protection
They say every man must fall
But I swear I can see my reflection
Some where so high above this wall
I see my light come shining
From the west down to the east
Any day now, any day now
I shall be released
Yondah stands a man in this lonely crowd
A man who swears he's not to blame
All day long I hear him crying out so loud
Crying cause he was framed
And the say I see my light come shining
From the west down to the east
Any day now, any day now
I shall be released"

Laggin' behind or losing yer pace
In a slowmotion crawl of life's busy race

If the wine don't come to the top of yer cup
Wind's got you sideways, one hand holdin' on
The other starts slipping and the feeling is gone
And yer train engine fire needs a new spark to catch it
Wood's easy findin' but yer lazy to fetch it
Lonesome comes up as down goes the day
And tomorrow's morning seems so far away
And you can feel the reins from yer pony are slippin'
And yer hands are aslidin', rope is adrippin'
Your sidewalk starts crawlin' and your streak is too long
And you start walkin' backwards but you know this is wrong
Sunny deserts and your evergreen valleys
Turn the brokendown slums and trashcan alleys
Your sky cries water and your drain pipes are pourin'
Lightnings aflashin' and your thunders acrashin'
Windows are rattlin' and breakin'
And your rooftop, well it starts shakin'
And your whole world is all
Slammin' and bangin'"

Willie Got Me Stoned (Live),Jack Johnson,Willie Nelson American Outlaw (Live),"{'year': 2020, 'month': 12, 'day': 11}","One of my favorite humans in the world
So nice to be here with you guys
Willie said one time that a good song is nothin' but three chords and the truth
I don't know if he made that up, but I heard him say it
And this next song right here, it's got three chords in it
And it's a true story about one night that I got to hang out with Willie
It all started when the show was over and we were in a big line
Everybody had their arms around each other
We wеre gettin' ready to takе a bow
And everybody else was sayin' things like
Hey, that was a great show, man"" and, you know
Beautiful crowd tonight"" and, you know, it's
Best ever,"" all that kind of stuff
And then Willie's right next to me and he leans over and he says
Hey, wanna go to my house and play some poker?""
And I, I said, Hell yeah, sounds amazing""
So this is a song I wrote, it's called Willie Got Me Stoned and Took All My Money,"" here you go
Willie got me stoned and took all my money
I was fifty dollars up, but then my mind went funny
It didn't really help that I didn't know the rules of the game
And it probably didn't help that I couldn't remember my name
After Willie got me stoned and took all my cash
One highlow split, but then he kicked my ass
He gave me knuckles across the table, but then my mind went blurry
And just like a puff of smoke, all my cash went up in a hurry
After Willie got me stoned, took me for everything I had
I had to walk home, I had no money for a cab
I didn't have the heart to ask anybody for a ride
And nobody in the room seemed any condition to drive
After Willie got us stoned, he took away my mind
He sent me back to the kiddie table, he took away my pride
And now I'm sittin' here with my band again, just feelin' like a joker
Just thinkin' about how bad I really suck at playin' poker
And thinkin' about my pockets, was Willie the one who broke them?
And would I really take a toke if they rolled Willie up and they smoked him?
Hell yes, I would, and I know it might sound funny
But Willie got me stoned and took all of my
Willie got me stoned and took all my money
Willie got me stoned and took all my money
Hell yes, I would, and I know it might sound funny

Wanted you to change, but I changed my mind instead
I wanted proof, you wanted something you could hold onto
But in the end, we mistook all the dissonance as the truth

Well, some will sleep in the back seat, some will look on down the road
Some are listening to  AM radio, screaming about

Broken hearts and white noise, busted souls, bloody noses
Get back up and stand in line, you owe it to the system
You trust sometimes, you walk away, you rebel and then you miss 'em
But you'll come home, you always do, it only hurts if you're paying attention

We heard it once, and maybe twice, under someone's breath as they walked by
But you don't buy that big old bag of lies, you've been adding up negative signs
It's fine, it's fine"", you've been saying for miles and miles
You've been raising all hell in such a laidback style


I'll get you home, I always do, I'll hold my breath if I have to
Windows down, it's dark out there, watch the wind blowing through your hair
Sleep now, dream now, anything you need now
A little more time and then the day begins to break again

Some will sleep in the back seat, some will look on down the road
Some are listening to  AM radio, singing about

Wrong turns and couldhavebeens, and everybody else's sins
And this one goes out to the one I love, just let me fall again
And again and again, and where do I begin?
Is there anybody out there even listening?

When I looked up, they were lost upon the tide
And now I'm just an island in these systems of silence
And as I drift around, I'm still bound to find the frowns
On the faces of my friends
Until the metronome ends

These windblown eyes, finding it hard to see
There's no straight lines out on this open sea
No way back home, only places to be
It's a wondrous world, but it's got the best of me

Got the best of, oohoohooh, oohoohoohooh
Got the best of, oohoohooh, oohoohoohooh

As if it was a given, I let the rhythm ease my mind
I pulled the cold out of the dark and I poured the darkness on the light
But I wanted more, and don't we all dissolve into the night
Only to wake up in the morning untied?
And all the blessed pieces, well, they been dust now for some time
And the rest, it carries on all imperfect and just fine
Another season gone, do I belong to them, or they to me?
Do the reflections, belong to the stars or to the sea?
How do I let go, of yesterday and yet to be?

With these windblown eyes, find it so hard to see
There's no straight lines out on this open sea
No way back home, only places to be

He says, Nope,"" when his friends ask him
If he thinks I'm really looking up from way down here

Is there really someone down there trying to hold on to a world?
He'll never see me writing notes, or knocking planets over with my pen
In this moment I stay still, I feel I should try to disturb nothing

But I tend to digress from time to time

Back hеre in the headlights, I comparе and I contrast
It's fair to say sometimes I make things last longer than they want to last
Fall when I was younger
Or next spring when I'll be singing songs about now
Wondering just how I got from there to here
Or the other way around, am I just a proper noun?

I tend to digress from time to time
Yeah, I tend to digress from time to time

Is it time to start over again?
Oh time, is it time to start over again?

But I want meaning, I want reason
It's not enough to have a pleasing morning
Listening to birds sing songs about getting their money's worth
Or the earth beneath the cement, beneath the chair I'm sitting in
Under the roof over my head, under a sky that's turning red
Under the stars, begin to shine as I become unstuck in time
Waking up in strange places, chasing good conversations with my friends
Where'd my mind go? With my friends, what do I know?

A mistake. They say
That his walls are getting taller

My words explode and split into electrodes
Giant step, I 
Sound checks and record stores and tape decks
Jack's reaction, robots heard the wack 
Broken dreams, living life on a silver screen
There's no static, closer to automatic
Movie magic, soundtrack so cinematic
So explosive, like Joe the lava flow
Body and soul  remote control
From the wayback track 
Spit fire from 

If the weather gets better
We should get together
Spend a little time and we could do whatever
And if we get together we'll be twice as clever
So, staple it together and call it bad weather, mm hmmm"

We'll stroll hand in hand again
In a land that knows no parting

But in some ways, they remain the same
And as my mind begins to spread its wings
There's no stopping curiosity

I wanna turn the whole thing upside down
I'll find the things they say just cant be found
I'll share this love I find with everyone
We'll sing and dance to Mother Nature's songs
I don't want this feeling to go away

Who's to say I can't do everything?
Well I can try
And as I roll along I begin to find
Things arеn't always just what they seem

I wanna turn the whole thing upsidе down

Please don't go away
Please don't go away
Please don't go away

Or brings new things
For tomorrow night you see
That they'll be gone too

But if all of these dreams might find their way
Into my day to day scene
I'd be under the impression
I was somewhere in between
With only two
Just me and you

Whistling static
When the young learn to fly I will patch all the holes up again

I thought it was sleeping
I guess it got fed up with not being fed
And I would be too, I need food in my belly and hope that my time isn't soon
So I, try, to understand, what I can't hold in my hand, and where ever we are
Home is there too
And if you, could try to find it too
Cause this place is overgrown into with works in bloom
Home is wherever we are, if there's love there too
In the back of our house there's a trail that won't end
We were walking so far that it grew back in
There's no trail at allonly grass growing tall
Get out my machete and battle with time once again
But I'm bound to lose because I'll be damned if time don't win
I gotta get home theirs a garden to tend, all the seeds from the fruit buried again
There own family trees teach them thank you and please as they spread their own roots they watch their young fruit grow again
And this old trail will lead me right back to where it begins
So I, try to understand, what I can't hold in my hand
And whatever I find, I'll find my way back to you

Memorizing details of your face
