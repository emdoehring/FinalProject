Mystery of Love,Sufjan Stevens,Mystery of Love,"{'year': 2017, 'month': 11, 'day': 3}","Oh, to see without my eyes
The first time that you kissed me
Boundless by the time I cried
I built your walls around me
White noise, what an awful sound
Fumbling by Rogue River
Feel my feet above the ground
Hand of God, deliver me

Oh, oh woeohwoah is me
The first time that you touched me
Oh, will wonders ever cease?
Blessed be the mystery of love

Lord, I no longer believe
Drowned in living waters
Cursed by the love that I received
From my brother's daughter
Like Hephaestion, who died
Alexander's lover
Now my riverbed has dried
Shall I find no other?

Oh, oh woeohwoah is me
I'm running like a plover
Now I'm prone to misery
The birthmark on your shoulder reminds me

How much sorrow can I take?
Blackbird on my shoulder
And what difference does it make
When this love is over?
Shall I sleep within your bed?
River of unhappiness
Hold your hands upon my head
Till I breathe my last breath
Oh, oh woeohwoah is me
The last time that you touched me
Oh, will wonders ever cease?
Blessed be the mystery of love"
Fourth of July,Sufjan Stevens,Carrie & Lowell,"{'year': 2015, 'month': 3, 'day': 31}","The evil, it spread like a fever ahead
It was night when you died, my firefly
What could I have said to raise you from the dead?
Oh, could I be the sky on the Fourth of July?
Well, you do enough talk
My little hawk, why do you cry?
Tell me, what did you learn from the Tillamook burn?
Or the Fourth of July?
We're all gonna die""

Sitting at the bed with the halo at your head
Was it all a disguise, like junior high?
Where everything was fiction, future, and prediction
Now, where am I? My fading supply

Did you get enough love, my little dove?
Why do you cry?
And I'm sorry I left, but it was for the best
Though it never felt right
My little Versailles""

The hospital asked, Should the body be cast?""
Before I say goodbye, my star in the sky
Such a funny thought to wrap you up in cloth
Do you find it all right, my dragonfly?

Shall we look at the moon, my little loon?
Why do you cry?
Make the most of your life, while it is rife
While it is light
Well, you do enough talk
My little hawk, why do you cry?
Tell me, what did you learn from the Tillamook burn?
Or the Fourth of July?
We're all gonna die""

We're all gonna die
We're all gonna die
We're all gonna die
We're all gonna die
We're all gonna die
We're all gonna die
We're all gonna die"
Should Have Known Better,Sufjan Stevens,Carrie & Lowell,"{'year': 2015, 'month': 3, 'day': 11}","To see what I could see
My black shroud
Holding down my feelings
A pillar for my enemies
I should have wrote a letter
And grieve what I happen to grieve
My black shroud
I never trust my feelings
I waited for the remedy
When I was three, three, maybe four
She left us at that video store
Oh, be my rest, be my fantasy
Oh, be my rest, be my fantasy
Im light as a feather
Im bright as the Oregon breeze
My black shroud
Frightened by my feelings
I only wanna be a relief
No, Im not a gogetter
The demon had a spell on me
My black shroud
Captain of my feelings
The only thing I wanna believe
When I was three, and free to explore
I saw her face on the back of the door
Oh, be my rest, be my fantasy
Oh, be my rest, be my fantasy
I should have known better
Nothing can be changed
The past is still the past
The bridge to nowhere
I should have wrote a letter
Explaining what I feel, that empty feeling
Dont back down, concentrate on seeing
The breakers in the bar, the neighbors greeting
My brother had a daughter
The beauty that she brings, illumination
Dont back down, there is nothing left
The breakers in the bar, no reason to live
Im a fool in the fetter fool in the fetter)
Rose of Aarons beard, where you can reach me
Dont back down: nothing can be changed
Cantilever bridge, the drunken sailor
My brother had a daughter brother had a daughter)
The beauty that she brings, illumination illumination)

Death with Dignity,Sufjan Stevens,Carrie & Lowell,"{'year': 2015, 'month': 3, 'day': 31}","Spirit of my silence, I can hear you
But Im afraid to be near you

Somewhere in the desert, theres a forest
And an acre before us
But I dont know where to begin

Again, I've lost my strength completely, oh be near me
Tired, old mare with the wind in your hair

Amethyst and flowers on the table On the table)

The Only Thing,Sufjan Stevens,Carrie & Lowell,"{'year': 2015, 'month': 3, 'day': 31}","The only thing that keeps me from driving this car
Halflight, jack knife into the canyon at night
Signs and wonders: Perseus aligned with the skull
Slain Medusa, Pegasus alight from us all

Do I care if I survive this? Bury the dead where theyre found
In a veil of great surprises, I wonder did you love me at all?

The only thing that keeps me from cutting my arm
Cross hatch, warm bath, Holiday Inn after dark
Signs and wonders: water stain riding the wall
Daniels message; blood of the moon on us all

Do I care if I despise this? Nothing else matters, I know
In a veil of great disguises; how do I live with your ghost?

Should I tear my eyes out now?
Everything I see returns to you, somehow
Should I tear my heart out now?
Everything I feel returns to you, somehow
I want to save you from your sorrow

The only reason why I continue at all
Faith in reason, I wasted my life playing dumb
Signs and wonders: sea lion caves in the dark
Blind faith, Gods grace, nothing else left to impart

Do I care if I survive this? Bury the dead where theyre found
In a veil of great surprises; hold to my head till I drown
Should I tear my eyes out now, before I see too much?
Should I tear my arms out now? I wanna feel your touch

Should I tear my eyes out now?
Everything I see returns to you, somehow
Should I tear my heart out now?
Everything I feel returns to you, somehow"
Casimir Pulaski Day,Sufjan Stevens,Illinois ,"{'year': 2005, 'month': 7, 'day': 4}","Goldenrod and the H stone
The things I brought you when I found out
You had cancer of the bone

Your father cried on the telephone
And he drove his car into the Navy yard
Just to prove that he was sorry

In the morning, through the window shade
When the light pressed up against your shoulderblade
I could see what you were reading
All the glory that the Lord has made
And the complications you could do without
When I kissed you on the mouth

Tuesday night at the Bible study
We lift our hands and pray over your body
But nothing ever happens

I remember at Michael's house
In the living room when you kissed my neck
And I almost touched your blouse

In the morning at the top of the stairs
When your father found out what we did that night
And you told me you were scared
All the glory when you ran outside
With your shirt tucked in and your shoes untied
And you told me not to follow you

Sunday night when I cleaned the house
I find the card where you wrote it out
With the pictures of your mother

On the floor at the great divide
With my shirt tucked in and my shoes untied
I am crying in the bathroom

In the morning when you finally go
And the nurse runs in with her head hung low
And the cardinal hits the window
In the morning in the winter shade
On the first of March, on the holiday
I thought I saw you breathing
All the glory that the Lord has made
And the complications when I see His face
In the morning in the window
All the glory when He took our place
But He took my shoulders and He shook my face
And He takes and He takes and He takes"
All of Me Wants All of You,Sufjan Stevens,Carrie & Lowell,"{'year': 2015, 'month': 3, 'day': 31}","Shall we beat this or celebrate it?
Youre not the one to talk things through
You checked your texts while I masturbated
Manelich, I feel so used

Found myself on Spencers Butte
Traced your shadow with my shoe
Empty outline changed my view
Now all of me thinks less of you

On the sheet, I see your horizon
All of me pressed onto you
But in this light, you look like Poseidon
Im just a ghost you walk right through

Saw myself on Spencers Butte All of me wants all of you)
Landscape changed my point of view All of me wants all of you)
Revelation may come true All of me wants all of you)
Now all of me thinks less of you All of me wants all of you)

John My Beloved,Sufjan Stevens,Carrie & Lowell,"{'year': 2015, 'month': 3, 'day': 31}","Are we to speak, first day of the week
Stumbling words at the bar
Beauty blue eyes, my order of fries
Long Island kindness and wine
Beloved of John, I get it all wrong
I read you for some kind of poem
Covered in lines, the fossils I find
Have they no life of their own?

So can we pretend, sweetly
Before the mystery ends?
I am a man with a heart that offends
With its lonely and greedy demands
Theres only a shadow of me; in a matter of speaking, I'm dead

Such a waste, your beautiful face
Stumbling carpet arise
Go follow your gem, your white feathered friend
Icarus, point to the sun
If history speaks of two baby teeth
Im painting the hills blue and red
They said beware, Lord, hear my prayer
Ive wasted my throes on your head

So can we be friends, sweetly
Before the mystery ends?
I love you more than the world can contain
In its lonely and ramshackle head
Theres only a shadow of me; in a matter of speaking, I'm dead

Im holding my breath
My tongue on your chest
What can be said of my heart?
If history speaks, the kiss on my cheek
Where there remains but a mark
Beloved, my John, so Ill carry on
Counting my cards down to one
And when I am dead, come visit my bed
My fossil is bright in the sun

So can we contend, peacefully
Before my history ends?
Jesus, I need you, be near me, come shield me
From fossils that fall on my head
Theres only a shadow of me; in a matter of speaking, I'm dead"
No Shade in the Shadow of the Cross,Sufjan Stevens,Carrie & Lowell,"{'year': 2015, 'month': 3, 'day': 31}","My only lover
Give out to give in
I search for the capsule I lost
Drag me to hell in the valley of The Dalles
Like my mother
Give wings to a stone
Its only the shadow of a cross
I slept on my back in the shade of the meadowlark
Like a champion
Get drunk to get laid
I take one more hit when you depart
I'll drive that stake through the center of my heart
Lonely vampire
Inhaling its fire
Im chasing the dragon too far
Theres blood on that blade
Fuck me, I'm falling apart
My assassin
Like Casper the ghost
Theres no shade in the shadow of the cross"
The Predatory Wasp of the Palisades Is Out to Get Us!,Sufjan Stevens,Illinois ,"{'year': 2005, 'month': 7, 'day': 4}","I hide in my bed with the lights on the floor
Wearing three layers of coats and leg warmers
I see my own breath on the face of the door
Oh I am not quite sleeping
Oh I am fast in bed
There on the wall in the bedroom creeping
I see a wasp with her wings outstretched
North of Savanna we swim in the Palisades
I come out wearing my brother's red hat
There on his shoulder my best friend is bit seven times
He runs washing his face in his hands
Oh how I meant to tease him
Oh how I meant no harm
Touching his back with my hand I kiss him
I see the wasp on the length of my arm
Oh great sights upon this state! Hallelu-
Wonders bright, and rivers, lake. Hallelu-
We were in love. We were in love
Palisades! Palisades!
I can wait. I can wait
Trail of Tears and Horseshoe Lake. Hallelu-
We were in love. We were in love
Palisades! Palisades!
I can wait. I can wait
Trusting things beyond mistake. Hallelu-

We were in love. We were in love
Palisades! Palisades!

Lamb of God, we sound the horn. Hallelu-
We were in love. We were in love
Palisades! Palisades!
I can wait. I can wait
Unto us your ghost is born. Hallelu-
I can't explain the state that I'm in
The state of my heart, he was my best friend
Into the car, from the back seat
Oh, admiration in falling asleep
All of my powers, day after day
I can tell you, we swaggered and swayed
Deep in the tower, the prairies below
I can tell you— the telling gets old
Terrible sting and terrible storm
I can tell you the day we were born
Oh great sights upon this state! Hallelu-
My friend is gone, he ran away
I can tell you, I love him each day
Wonders bright, and rivers, lake. Hallelu-
Though we have sparred, wrestled and raged
I can tell you I love him each day
Trail of Tears and Horseshoe Lake. Hallelu-
Terrible sting, terrible storm
I can tell you...
We were in love. We were in love
Palisades! Palisades!
I can wait. I can wait
Trusting things beyond mistake. Hallelu-"
John Wayne Gacy Jr.,Sufjan Stevens,Illinois ,"{'year': 2005, 'month': 7, 'day': 4}","His father was a drinker
And his mother cried in bed
Folding John Wayne's tshirts
When the swingset hit his head
The neighbors they adored him
For his humor and his conversation
Look underneath the house there
Find the few living things, rotting fast, in their sleep
Oh, the dead
Twentyseven people
Even more, they were boys
With their cars, summer jobs
Oh my God
Are you one of them?

He dressed up like a clown for them
With his face paint white and red
And on his best behavior
In a dark room on the bed
He kissed them all
He'd kill ten thousand people
With a sleight of his hand
Running far, running fast to the dead
He took off all their clothes for them
He put a cloth on their lips
Quiet hands, quiet kiss on the mouth

And in my best behavior
I am really just like him
Look beneath the floor boards
For the secrets I have hid"

Lemon yogurt
Remember I pulled at your shirt
I dropped the ashtray on the floor
I just wanted to be near you
Emerald Park, wonders never cease
The man who taught me to swim
He couldn't quite say my first name
Like a Father, he led community water on my head
And he called me Subaru”
And now, I want to be near you
Since I was old enough to speak
I've said it with alarm
Some part of me was lost in your sleeve
Where you hid your cigarettes
No, Ill never forget
I just want to be near you
Still, I pray to what I cannot see
In the sprinkler, I mark
The evidence known from the start
From the bed near your death
And all the machines that made a mess
Far away, the falcon flew
Now I want to be near you
Whats left is only bittersweet
For the rest of my life
Admitting the best is behind me
Now Im drunk and afraid
Wishing the world would go away
Whats the point of singing songs
If theyll never even hear you?"
Futile Devices,Sufjan Stevens,The Age of Adz,"{'year': 2010, 'month': 10, 'day': 12}","It's been a long, long time since I've memorized your face
It's been four hours now since I've wandered through your place
And when I sleep on your couch, I feel very safe
And when you bring the blankets, I cover up my face

I do love you
I do, oohooh, love you

And when you play guitar, I listen to the strings buzz
The metal vibrates underneath your fingers
And when you crochet, I feel mesmerized and proud
And I would say I love you, but saying it out loud is hard
So I won't say it at all
And I won't stay very long

But you are the life I needed all along
I think of you as my brother
Although that sounds dumb
And words are futile devices"

Oh, great intentions
I've got the best of interventions
But when the ads come
I think about it now

Entrepreneurial conditions
Take us to glory
I think about it now

Cannot conversations cull united nations?
If you got the patience, celebrate the ancients
Cannot all creation call it celebration?
Or united nation, put it to your head

Oh, great white city
I've got the adequate committee
Where have your walls gone?
I think about it now

Chicago, in fashion
The soft drinks, expansion
Oh, Columbia!
From Paris, incentive
Like Cream of Wheat invented
The Ferris Wheel!

Oh, great intentions
Covenant with the imitation
Have you no conscience?
I think about it now

Oh, God of Progress
Have you degraded or forgot us?
Where have your laws gone?
I think about it now

Ancient hieroglyphic or the South Pacific
Typically terrific, busy and prolific
Classical devotion, architect promotion
Lacking in emotion, think about it now
Chicago, the New Age
But what would Frank Lloyd Wright say?
Oh, Columbia!
Amusement or treasure
These optimistic pleasures
Like the Ferris Wheel!

Cannot conversations cull united nations?
If you got the patience, celebrate the ancients

I cried myself to sleep last night
And the ghost of Carl, he approached my window
I was hypnotized, I was asked to improvise
On the attitude, the regret
Of a thousand centuries of death

Even with the heart of terror and the superstitious wearer
I am riding all alone
I am writing all alone
Even in my best condition
Counting all the superstition
I am riding all alone
I am running all alone
And we laughed at the beatitudes of a thousand lines
We were asked at the attitudes
They reminded us of death

Even with the rest belated, Everything is antiquated
Are you writing from the heart?
Are you writing from the heart?
Even in his heart, the Devil has to know the water level
Are you writing from the heart?
Are you writing from the heart?

And I cried myself to sleep last night
For the Earth, and materials
They may sound just right to me

Even with the rest belated, everything is antiquated
Are you writing from the heart?
Are you writing from the heart?

Even in his heart, the Devil has to know the water level
Are you writing from the heart?
Are you writing from the heart?"

Romulus,Sufjan Stevens,Michigan (Vinyl Version),"{'year': 2003, 'month': 7, 'day': 1}","Once when our mother called
She had a voice of last year's cough
We passed around the phone
Sharing a word about Oregon

When my turn came, I was ashamed
When my turn came, I was ashamed

Once when we moved away
She came to Romulus for a day
Her Chevrolet broke down
We prayed it'd never be fixed or be found

We touched her hair, we touched her hair
We touched her hair, we touched her hair

When she had her last child
Once when she had some boyfriends, some wild
She moved away quite far
Our grandpa bought us a new VCR
We watched it all night, we grew up in spite of it
We watched it all night, we grew up in spite of it

We saw her once last fall
Our grandpa died in a hospital gown
She didn't seem to care
She smoked in her room and colored her hair

I was ashamed, I was ashamed of her
I was ashamed, I was ashamed of her
I was ashamed, I was ashamed of her
I was ashamed, I was ashamed of her"

Forgetting the light that makes you go blind

If courage is love of the unknown
Consider the powers parading you home

You stand in the shade to feel it was blessed
Obscuring from light the seeds you possess
I'm on the path of trust, singing

But it takes one to know one
And God only knows what you are
Just some Portland white trash
You confronted your sorrow
Like there was no tomorrow
While the rest of the world only laughed
Triple axel on high
A delightful disaster
You jumped farther and faster
You were always so full of surprises
Are your laces untied?
Whats the frown on your face for?
And just what are the skates for now?
Tell me which is your good side?
Are you lonely at night?
Do you miss all the glory
And the mythical story
Of the Olympian life?
Yamaguchi in red
She had high rise and roses
And redcarpet poses
And her outfit was splendid
Nancy Kerrigans charm
Well she took quite a beating
So youre not above cheating
Can you blame her for crying?
Tonya, you were the brightest
Yeah you rose from the ashes
And survived all the crashes
Wiping the blood from your white tights
Has the world had its fun?
Yeah theyll make such a hassle
And theyll build you a castle
Then destroy it when theyre done
Tonya Harding, my friend
Well this world is a bitch, girl
Dont end up in a ditch, girl
Ill be watching you close to the end
So fight on as you are

May God bless you with incense
Youre my shining American star

To bear it down, to be in flight

Impatience and a painted bust
I kept you close to me, close to my ear

We set out once with folded shirts
With hairy chest and all rehearsed
I want it all, I want it all for myself
I'll set it right between your eyes
Your shoulder blade, your running life
I want it all, I want it all for myself

Improving all the time, I am
Improving as I kiss the hem
I promise I won't be a trouble at all
For I'm okay, I'm in the red
Impressions of the unmade bed
You cradled close to me, close to my ear

We set out once, forget our shirts
With hairy chests and wellrehearsed
I want it all, I want it all for myself
For in the earth I smell of you
A bathing boy, amazing view
I want it all, I want it all for myself"

Leviathan first hid in the deep where her children sleep
She kept them hidden from the plague
But have you heard the story of my mothers fate?
She left us in Detroit in the rain with a pillowcase
Fortune for the paperweight

We followed her to Joseph, near the Indian raid
She wept among the weeds, hide and seek, for the fallen chief
Spathiphyllum on his grave
And like the cedar waxwing, she was drunk all day
We put her in the sheet, little wreath, candles on the crate
As the monster showed its face

As she waits for her children in the shade
Demogorgon or demigod the ghost parade
No oblation will bring her back to our place

She stayed within the deep end of Wallowa Lake
The undertow refrained with the flame of a feathered snake
Charybdis in its shallow grave
She gave us one last feature, the fullness of her face
In the shade of Hinmahtooyah…"", Red Napoleon
As the demon took her place

As we wait for the waters to reside
Her remarkable stoicism and her pride
When the dragon submerged we knew she had died

The Ascension,Sufjan Stevens,The Ascension,"{'year': 2020, 'month': 9, 'day': 25}","When I am dead and the light leaves my breast
Nothing to be told, nothing to confess
Let the record show what I couldn't quite confess
For by living for myself, I was living for unrest
Then the evidence came back in a chariot of vindication
Something to behold, glorious in its path
But the prophecy fell back as it gave to me an invitation
Show them what is right, show them what is blessed

But now it strikes me far too late again
That I was asking far too much of everyone around me
And now it strikes me far too late again
That I should answer for myself as the Ascension falls upon me

So what should be said of a life that leaves its mess?
For once your life was sold it could never be possessed
You were selfishly as a continent, you were finally at your best
For you favored for yourself when selfishness was blessed
Then Cordelia came back in a chariot hallucination
Something to rejoice, glorious in its wrath
But the prophecy was a pantomime as it came to me in accusation
Show them what is right, show them what is best

But now it strikes me far too late again
That I was asking far too much of everyone around me
And now it strikes me far too late again
That I should answer for myself as the Ascension falls upon me

And now it frightens me, the thought against my chest
To think I was asking for a reason, explaining why everything's a total mess
And now it frightens me, the dreams that I possess
To think I was acting like a believer, when I was just angry and depressed

And to everything, there is no meaning, a season of pain and hopelessness
I shouldn't have looked for revelation, I should have resigned myself to this
I thought I could change the world around me, I thought I could change the world for best
I thought I was called in convocation, I thought I was sanctified and blessed

But now it strengthens me to know the truth at last
That everything comes from consummation, and everything comes with consequence
And I did it all with exultation, while you did it all with hopelessness
Yes, I did it all with adoration, while you killed it off with all of your holy mess

What now? What now?)
What now?)
What now?)
What now?)
What now? What now?)

I wait beside the door

Trembling in the cage
I was diamonds in the cage
In seven hours I consider death
And your father called to yell at me
You little boy, you little boy""
Found out you cheated me
I ran behind the barn
And cut my hands somehow
Blood in the meadowlark
I punched your ears instead
I punched you in the head
You only laughed and laughed and laughed
How I was wrong
Tingling from the kill
Tickle me until
You devil bird, you evil still
Slept on my arms
Sleeping in the sill
I was sleeping in the room with you

How could you run from me now?

Come to me Calvary still
Im weeding and raking until
Im bleeding in spite of my love for you
It bruised and bruised my will
Counting alluvial plains
The breathing inside of the range
You touched me inside of my cage
Beneath my shirt your hands embraced me
Come to me feathered and frayed
For I am the ugliest prey
For I am the ugliest prey
The owl, the reckless, reckless praise
You said youd wait for me
Down by the Tannery Creek
Far out by the clothesline
Where we used to kiss behind the sheets
Wrapped in a blanket of red

The Owl and the Tanager said
One waits until the hour is death"

Ideas of strength and style abated by the burning basement

In spite of all the terror and abuse

Compost preacher, pioneer believer

A small betrayal, a simple thought
To shrug it off, unoccupied

The rising tide
The sad surprise, the day of flags
The flooding fox, the clever chime
Awake my soul, awake my heart
And you will find

His countenance was modified
His clothing was aflame
Two men appeared
Moses and Elijah came, they were at his side
The prophecy, the legislation
Spoke of whenever he would die
Then there came a word
Of what he should accomplish on the day
Then Peter spoke, to make of them
A tabernacle place
A cloud appeared in glory as an accolade
They fell on the ground
A voice arrived, the voice of God
The face of God, covered in a cloud
What he said to them
The voice of God: the most beloved son
Consider what he says to you
Consider what's to come
The prophecy was put to death
Was put to death, and so will the Son
And keep your word
Disguise the vision till the time has come
Lost in the cloud, a voice: Have no fear! We draw near!
Lost in the cloud, a sign: Son of man! Turn your ear!
Lost in the cloud, a voice: Lamb of God! We draw near!
Lost in the cloud, a sign: Son of man! Son of God!

Hes the heart grabber back stabber double cheater wife beater

When the water ran water ran with the strange attic
And when the walls were wet with your life
And you pushed yourself to the floor
And the spirit went where it went
Hovering discovering uncovering your life, on the floor
And the walls were wet with your love

With a history of medical care
Im frantic shopper and a brave pill popper

We are masters of mystique

It was something of a phantom synapsis
Now everything is slipping out of my hands
You get me out of this and I'll give you access
At the risk of sounding like a Confucian
I'm gonna take it one day at a time
Let's keep it simple, give me absolution
Let's take a walk in the circle of light
Let's take a walk in the circle of light

There's nowhere to run
There's nowhere to hide
My love is a wave
You got me caught in a landslide

I buy it all the time
You tell me take it back
You say you'll take a nap
But I can see it now
You always tell me how
I could do so much better
You said it in your letter
Did I make you cry
On Christmas day?
Did I let you down
Like every other day?
Did I make you cry
On Christmas day?
Did I let you down

The bed that isn't made
The broken window shade
The radiator song, I loved you all along
But I can see it now
You always tell me how
I could do so much better
You said it in your letter
I stay awake at night
After we have a fight
I'm writing poems about you
And they're not very nice
I didn't mean to yell
I said I couldn't tell
I only grabbed your wrist
Or would you rather we kissed?
Did I make you cry
On Christmas day?
Did I make you cry
Like every other day?
Did I make you cry

Like there was no tomorrow
While the rest of the world only laughed

You jumped farther and faster
You were always so full of surprises
Are your laces untied?
Whats the frown on your face for?
And just what are the skates for now?
Tell me which is your good side?
Are you lonely at night?
Do you miss all the glory
Or the mythical story
Of the Olympian life?

Yeah you rose from the ashes
And survived all the crashes
Wiping the blood from your white tights

And theyll build you a castle

Who died in his sleep when the world was a very big mess
A very big mess
He saw too much
From now on I will look away from every accident
That may or may not come my way
Saw you were talking up above the Aleph room
Masquerading as a loom
Both of us saw things
No one else would see as well
From the mouth of Gabriel
No one else would hear as well
From the mouth of Gabriel
From the mouth of Gabriel
From the mouth of Gabriel
From the mouth of Gabriel
Dont be so sure of what you feel, it might as well be trouble
From now on just let the universe be your shelter from the enemy
Your face has changed
I hardly know who you are this time
And what a mess Ive made of you
You probably would but I wont let you run away
You probably should but I wont let you run away this time
Dont be afraid of loneliness, some refugee beside itself
Instead of what youve got
You probably would but I wont let you go away
You probably should but I wont let you go away this time
Your face has changed
I hardly know who you are this time
And when I came into your room
You tried to jump
Now I know this is strange to hear from the mouth of God
It was something like a scene from Mars
In a struggle between loves and lies
The angel kept his face covered for to keep his word
And while I spoke something left from my life
Forget about the past
Be at rest Ill make things right
And while I held you at best you nearly died
Forget about the past
And Ill try to make things right"

Stones and sled, it could have been some other

Will never stand at all
Will never stand as tall
Since the water made it
Most to sail it
Made it most to song
It made it most to song

For what they stand
For not what they demand
Every senator and diplomat
Combines her certain part
A matter for the heart
Save yourself from recognition
Selflessness and quiet song
To better get along

We made to. We love you.)

Resources to the highest poll
To beat the highest pull, too
Ever we will conquer grief
And find it faster to resolve
The dead, to be absolved
And fed, to restore

Reprimand misgivings

We will not!

Stumbling words at the bar
Beauty blue eyes, my order of fries
Long island kindness and wine
Beloved of John, I get it all wrong
I read you for some kind of stone
Covered in lines, the fossils I find
Have they no life of their own?

So can we pretend sweetly
Before the mystery ends?
I am a man with a heart that offends
With its lonely and greedy demands
Theres only a shadow of me; in a manner of speaking I'm dead

Such a waste, your beautiful face
Slumbering carpet arise
But you and your ring, your lifegiving string
Come to me now as a friend
If history speaks, the kiss on my cheek
Im painting the hills blue and red
They said beware, Lord hear my prayer
Anointing my love on your head

So can we be friends sweetly
Before the mystery ends?
I love you more than the world can contain
In its loneliest ramshackle head
Theres only a shadow of me; in a manner of speaking I'm dead

Im holding my breath
My signature death
What can be said of my heart?
If history speaks, the kiss on my cheek
Where there remains but a mark
Beloved my John, so Ill carry on
Counting my cards down to one
And when I am dead, return to the bed
My fossil is bright in the sun"

Streams of mercy, never ceasing
Call for songs of loudest praise
Teach me some melodious sonnet
Sung by flaming tongues above
Praise the mount, I'm fixed upon it
Mount of Thy unchanging love
Here I raise my Ebenezer
Hither by Thy help I come
And I hope, by Thy good pleasure
Safely to arrive at home
Jesus sought me when a stranger
Wandering from the fold of God
He, to rescue me from danger
Interposed His precious blood
O to grace how great a debtor
Daily I'm constrained to be
Let that grace now, like a fetter
Bind my wandering heart to Thee
Prone to wander, Lord, I feel it
Prone to leave the God I love
Here's my heart, O take and seal it
Seal it for Thy courts above
Come, Thou Fount of every blessing
Tune my heart to sing Thy grace

Call for songs of loudest praise

Please, don't let your children die tonight
Whatever is wrong or right
Let them sleep in peace

And where the rosе converged
Wild foxes on thе curb
Poison ivy, poison motherhood
How can I think of this?
The one paralysis
The kiss of Niobe persuaded it

And when our laureate left
She did it for the best
And raised her single wing with confidence
For if she stayed instead
With wildness on her head
She would've killed us without consequence

Release the demon Sylvian fraud tonight
I see you in my line of sight
Dressed in golden fleece
Please, don't let your children die tonight
Whatever is wrong or right
Let them sleep in ease

With unicorns and buffalo backs
I know that you would wake up
With the sunny side touching your back

Is it the lonely man of Christmas?
Coming up with theories on him
Is it the lonely man of Christmas?
He's riding in the devil's abyss

Oh I would write the future
If I could put my finger on it
But I have no idea
If what I want is better than this

Is it the lonely man of Christmas?
He's hoping for a break in the plan
Is it the lonely drive to Denver?
The loneliness of holding your hand

Is it the time we spent in silence
The silence of a wintery head
Is it the lonely man of winter?
I could put my finger on that

And even if it's Christmas
Could we just pretend for a bit
That everything we went through
Was something so much better than this

The circle swell, a sudden light
Takes me

Takes me
Takes me
Takes me
Takes me

Upon the ridge
Horizon's eye
Above the gray sky
I tip my oar to raise the stroke
The wading swan, the image broke
A looming peak, a pirate size
Uprears its head a sudden guise

Like when I went to school, drinking coffee at night
And I did what I did, now I do what I like
Open the champagne, party and pensive
Your mother said it's very expensive
Do what you want to, don't even ask us
Paraguay, Boston, Philly, Damascus
Maybe it's the snow, the endless winter nights
And the winter coat, the one you never liked
But I'll take the sun and I'll take my kite
Christmas on the beach, Christmas in July
And I love my friends, even if they fight
Christmas in July, just to keep them quiet
And I love you too, I love you through the night
But now that you're away, Christmas isn't right
Don't take offenses, come to your senses
Your confidence is straddling fences

I'm not one to regret Christmas in July"

Break a promise if you're, if you're able

I went dancing with my sister
Call her madam, call me mister
She wore a dress, it was nice and something
Underneath her dress was slipping
She did curtsy, she did cupid
She said she did something stupid
I said: who's the buster, guider?

Point me to the middle section

And an acre before us

Again I've lost my strength completely, oh be near me
Tired old mare with the wind in your hair

Amethyst and flowers on the table, is it real or a fable?
Well I suppose a friend is a friend
And we all know how this will end

Chimney swift that finds me, be my keeper
Silhouette of the cedar
What is that song you sing for the dead?
What is that song you sing for the dead?
I see the signal searchlight strike me in the window of my room
Well I got nothing to prove
Well I got nothing to prove

I forgive you, mother, I can hear you
And I long to be near you

Yes every road leads to an end

Beloved of John, I get it all wrong
I read you for some kind of poem
Covered in lines, the fossils I find
Have they no life of their own?

So can we pretend, sweetly
Before the mystery ends?
I am a man with a heart that offends
With its lonely and greedy demands
Theres only a shadow of me; in a matter of speaking, I'm dead

Such a waste, your beautiful face
Stumbling carpet arise
Go follow your gem, your white feathered friend
Icarus, point to the sun
If history speaks of two baby teeth
Im painting the hills blue and red
They said beware, Lord, hear my prayer
Ive wasted my throes on your head

So can we be friends, sweetly
Before the mystery ends?
I love you more than the world can contain
In its lonely and ramshackle head
Theres only a shadow of me; in a matter of speaking, I'm dead

Im holding my breath
My tongue on your chest
What can be said of my heart?
If history speaks, the kiss on my cheek
Where there remains but a mark
Beloved, my John, so Ill carry on
Counting my cards down to one
And when I am dead, come visit my bed
My fossil is bright in the sun

So can we contend, peacefully
Before my history ends?
Jesus, I need you, be near me, come shield me
From fossils that fall on my head

Should I tear my heart out now?
Everything I feel returns to you, somehow
I want to save you from your sorrow

The only reason why I continue at all
Faith in reason, I wasted my life playing dumb
Signs and wonders: sea lion caves in the dark
Blind faith, Gods grace, nothing else left to impart

Do I care if I survive this? Bury the dead where theyre found
In a veil of great surprises; hold to my head till I drown

Should I tear my arms out now? I wanna feel your touch

From the bed near your death, and all the machines that made a mess
Far away, the falcon flew

For the rest of my life, admitting the best is behind me

Somewhere in the desert, theres a forest
And an acre before us
But I dont know where to begin
But I dont know where to begin
Again, I've lost my strength completely, oh be near me
Tired, old mare with the wind in your hair

Amethyst and flowers on the table, is it real or a fable?
Well, I suppose a friend is a friend
And we all know how this will end

Chimney swift that finds me, be my keeper
Silhouette of the cedar
What is that song you sing for the dead?
What is that song you sing for the dead?
I see the signal searchlight strike me in the window of my room
Well, I got nothing to prove
Well, I got nothing to prove

I forgive you, mother, I can hear you
And I long to be near you
But every road leads to an end
Yes, every road leads to an end
Your apparition passes through me in the willows
Five red hens – youll never see us again
Youll never see us again"
No Shade in the Shadow of the Cross - Live,Sufjan Stevens,Carrie & Lowell Live,"{'year': 2017, 'month': 4, 'day': 28}","My only lover
Give out to give in
I search for the capsule I lost
Drag me to hell in the valley of The Dalles
Like my mother
Give wings to a stone
Its only the shadow of a cross
I slept on my back in the shade of the meadowlark
Like a champion
Get drunk to get laid
I take one more hit when you depart
I'll drive that stake through the center of my heart
Lonely vampire
Inhaling its fire
Im chasing the dragon too far
Therеs blood on that blade
Fuck me, I'm falling apart
My assassin
Like Caspеr the ghost
Theres no shade in the shadow of the cross"

And stay by my side until morning is nigh
Be near me, Lord Jesus, I ask you to stay
Close by me for ever, and love me, I pray

You can't please them all
There's always someone calling you down
Calling you down, calling you down
But I do my best
And I do good business, I do it well
There's a lot of people asking for my time
Trying to get ahead
They're trying to be a good friend of mine
I deal in dreamers and telephone screamers
Lately, I wonder what I do it for
If l had my way
I'd walk through those doors
And wander down the ChampsElysees
Going cafe to cabaret
Thinking how I'll feel when I find
That very good friend of mine
I was a free man in Paris
I felt unfettered and alive)
Nobody was calling me up for favors

Holding down my feelings
A pillar for my enemies
I should have wrote a letter
And grieve what I happen to grieve

I never trust my feelings

She left us at that video store
Oh, be my rest, be my fantasy
Oh, be my rest, be my fantasy
Im light as a feather
Im bright as the Oregon breeze
My black shroud
Frightened by my feelings
I only wanna be a reliеf
No, Im not a gogetter
The dеmon had a spell on me
My black shroud
Captain of my feelings
The only thing I wanna believe
When I was three, and free to explore
I saw her face on the back of the door
Oh, be my rest, be my fantasy
Oh, be my rest, be my fantasy
I should have known better
Nothing can be changed
The past is still the past
The bridge to nowhere
I should have wrote a letter
Explaining what I feel, that empty feeling
Dont back down, concentrate on seeing
The breakers in the bar, the neighbors greeting
My brother had a daughter
The beauty that she brings, illumination
Dont back down, there is nothing left
The breakers in the bar, no reason to live
Im a fool in the fetter fool in the fetter)
Rose of Aarons beard, where you can reach me
Dont back down: nothing can be changed
Cantilever bridge, the drunken sailor
