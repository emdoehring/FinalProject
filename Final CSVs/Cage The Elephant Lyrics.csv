Cigarette Daydreams,Cage The Elephant,Melophobia,"{'year': 2013, 'month': 10, 'day': 8}","Did you stand there all alone?
Oh, I cannot explain what's going down
I can see you standing next to me
In and out somewhere else right now
You sigh, look away
I can see it clear as day
Close your eyes, so afraid
Hide behind that baby face

Dododo, dododo

You can drive all night
Looking for the answers in the pouring rain
You wanna find peace of mind
Looking for the answer

Funny how it seems like yesterday
As I recall, you were looking out of place
Gathered up your things and slipped away
No time at all, I followed you into the hall
Cigarette daydreams
You were only seventeen
So sweet with a mean streak
Nearly brought me to my knees

Dododo, dododo

You can drive all night
Looking for the answers in the pouring rain
You wanna find peace of mind
Looking for the answer
If we can find a reason, a reason to change
Looking for the answer
If you can find a reason, a reason to stay
Standing in the pouring rain

Dodo, dododo
Dodo, dodododo
Dodo, dododo
Dodo, dodododo

You can drive all night
Looking for the answers in the pouring rain
You wanna find peace of mind
Looking for the answer
If we can find a reason, a reason to change
Looking for the answer
If you can find a reason, a reason to stay
Standing in the pouring rain"

Casting shadows, the sun was pushing through

Got so much to lose
Got so much to prove
God, don't let me lose my mind

Trouble on my left, trouble on my right
I've been facing trouble almost all my life

Ain’t No Rest for the Wicked,Cage The Elephant,Cage The Elephant,"{'year': 2008, 'month': 6, 'day': 16}","I was walking down the street when out the corner of my eye
I saw a pretty little thing approaching me
She said, I never seen a man, who looks so all alone
Oh, could you use a little company?
If you pay the right price, your evening will be nice
And you can go and send me on my way.""
I said, You're such a sweet young thing, why you do this to yourself?""
She looked at me and this is what she said:

Oh there ain't no rest for the wicked
Money don't grow on trees
I got bills to pay, I got mouths to feed
There ain't nothing in this world for free
Oh no, I can't slow down, I can't hold back
Though you know, I wish I could
Oh no there ain't no rest for the wicked
Until we close our eyes for good""

Not even fifteen minutes later I'm still walking down the street
When I saw the shadow of a man creep out out of sight
And then he swept up from behind, he put a gun up to my head
He made it clear he wasn't looking for a fight
He said, Give me all you've got, I want your money, not your life
But if you try to make a move, I won't think twice""
I told him, You can have my cash, but first you know I gotta ask
What made you want to live this kind of life?""

He said, There ain't no rest for the wicked
Money don't grow on trees
I got bills to pay, I got mouths to feed
There ain't nothing in this world for free
Oh no, I can't slow down, I can't hold back
Though you know, I wish I could
Oh no there ain't no rest for the wicked
Until we close our eyes for good""

Well now a couple hours passed and I was sitting in my house
The day was winding down and coming to an end
And so I turned on the TV and flipped it over to the news
And what I saw I almost couldn't comprehend
I saw a preacher man in cuffs, he'd taken money from the church
He'd stuffed his bank account with righteous dollar bills
But even still I can't say much because I know we're all the same
Oh yes, we all seek out to satisfy those thrills
You know there ain't no rest for the wicked
Money don't grow on trees
We got bills to pay, we got mouths to feed
There ain't nothing in this world for free
Oh no we can't slow down, we can't hold back
Though you know we wish we could
Oh no there ain't no rest for the wicked
Until we close our eyes for good"
Come a Little Closer,Cage The Elephant,Melophobia,"{'year': 2013, 'month': 8, 'day': 13}","Time shakes, found you at the water
At first you were my father
Now I love you like a brother
Earthquakes shake the dust behind you

Come on, come on, come on

Come on, come on, come on
Do you understand the things that you've been seein'?
Come on, come on, come on
Do you understand the things that you've been dreamin'?

Heartbreaks, the heavy worlds upon your shoulders
Will we burn on or just smolder?

Tomorrow it will rise

Telescope,Cage The Elephant,Melophobia,"{'year': 2013, 'month': 10, 'day': 8}","In a far and distant galaxy
Inside my telescope I see
A pair of eyes peer back at me

From room to room, he moves about
Fills his life with pointless things
And wonders how it all turns out

Dododododo
Dododododo
It's safe to say that

I don't think you understand
There's nowhere left to turn, the walls keep breaking
Time is like a leaf in the wind
Either it's time well spent or time I've wasted
Don't waste it

Afraid of what the truth might bring
He locks his doors and never leaves
Desperately searching for signs
Too terrified to find a thing
He battens all the hatches down
And wonders why he hears no sounds
Frantically searching his dreams
He wonders what it's all about

Here in my mind, losing my friends
Fall on my face, do it again
You say, How do you do?""
Man, how 'bout you? Man, how 'bout you?
To be free, to be sold
To be killed, to be safe
In my head, I'm alone
I'm not dead, I'm ashamed
Just like you, I've been trying to escape
In my bones, I feel cold
I give thanks to the Lord
Industry, in the street
Let me go, let me be
I don't need to be here
I'm alone, can't you see? Can't you see?
I don't think you understand
There's nowhere left to turn, these walls keep breaking
Time is like a leaf in the wind
Either it's time well spent or time I've wasted
Don't waste it"

Times I wonder are we just a puff of smoke? Yeah
Underneath this bed of ashes, still withholding everything
Like we were never close

Dont you worry, baby, no sense trying to change it
I'ma strike these matches, never had control
I'm ready to let go, no, was I fooling myself?
Ima spread these ashes, never had control
I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready to let go

Sun went down, sun went down over Pompeii
On holy ground, our vows were broken
We met up, we broke bread
I was blue, your dress was red
Ain't it strange?
We both knew this day was coming

Times I wonder are we just a puff of smoke? Yeah

Everyone's been searching high and low
And your mother's worried sick
Dearest daddy lost his grip
While the whole world's watching
Candlelight vigils being held in silence
On the channel four
And they've knocked on every door
Every place you've been before

How long will we let it go?
I think we should just let go

I, I want you back back)
Let's get back
Lay my weary head against your bones
Where all my troubles will be dead and gone

How long will we let it go?
I think we should just let go

Has melancholy taken you for good?
You know that I would save you if I could
Watched your laughter turn to tears
Then you vanished in thin air
Well we pinned your missing persons picture up
On every motherloving post
How's it feel to be a ghost?
You're the one I love the most

I, I want you back back)
Let's get back
Lay my weary head against your breast
Where all our troubles will be laid to rest

I pushed and I pulled 'til I pushed you aside
Now all that is left are the tears that you cried
I'm sorry love for all of the damage done
My only hope is someday to be back beside you

Who knows now? Softly laying on the ground
Oooh not a lot of people left around oooh oooh

In my life I have seen people walk into the sea
Just to find memories plagued by constant misery
Their eyes cast down, fixed upon the ground
Their eyes cast down

I'll keep my eyes fixed on the sun

Shake me down, cut my head on a silver cloud
Broken sound, softly laying on the ground
Oooh not a lot of people left around oooh oooh

In my past, bittersweet, there's no love between the sheets
Taste the blood, broken dreams, lonely times in deed
With eyes cast down, fixed upon the ground, with eyes cast down

I'll keep my eyes fixed on the sun
Turn back now, it's time for me to let go
Way down, had to find a place to lay low
Lamp shade, turned around into a light post

Walk around the corner, never saw it coming, still
I try to make a move it almost stopped me from belief
I don't want to know the future, I'm like Rolling Thunder
Even on a cloudy day
Even on a cloudy day
Even on a cloudy day
Even on a cloudy day
Even on a cloudy day
Even on a cloudy day
Even on a cloudy day

Where have all the storytellers gone?

And then I lose my voice in between the echoes of selfserving prophecy
A captain without his ship, a chiefa chief without a tribe
A raging megalomaniac who only speaks to hear his cheeks slap together and worship the sound of his own voice
A muffled crya muffled crya muffled crya muffled cry
Power concaved inside a woman
To configure through the mythical power of the trees, the graphics being paper th—
Paper thin garments and garments and garments and garments and garments and garments and garments and garments
Pray for summer days
The rain and wind is so strong outside my window
And winter's always searching for another
I hearI hear his cheeks slap together and worship his own voice
Loulouder? Okay, alright
I'm so tired of the demands of this world, her nagging voice
The song she sings, the songs that she desires
She cries out in the heat of her passions
Her legs spread ready forready for a stranger
The captain without his ship, a chief witha chief without a tribe
A raging megalomaniac who only speaks to hear his cheeks slap together and worship the sound of his own voice
I dare not take another drink until it's gone
Just when did I become so eaten up by moss and covered in a cloak of popularity?
When I lose my voice in between the echoes of selfserving prophecy"

I've been running for so long

If I fall, I'll tuck and roll
Close my eyes and let the lovelight guide me home
Let the lovelight guide me home

One step fades and falls into another
I'm not getting any further
Left here feeling like an alien

Lost myself while I was hiding

Burn me at the stake and sit and watch it from their throne
They say the devil is my pal, I do a lot of drugs

Trying to pick up a girl?

Is she lying on some tropical beach somewhere
Underneath a tropical sun?
Pining away in a heatwave there
Hoping that I won't be long

I should be lying on that sunswept beach with her
Caressing her warm, brown skin
And then in a year, or maybe not quite
We'll be sharing the same next of kin

I found it tucked beneath the hills
I sat and watched it rise
It hit the sky and burst to flames
The lotus flower's
Got me thinking bout the way that we live
I've got this feeling
It's gonna stop
Driven by religion
Running backwards down a one way road
A course collision, split decision
Trying to save your soul
Manifest Destiny
Is just a fancy word for murder
I've got this feeling
It's gonna stop

A billion faces running round my head
All got opinions but they don't mean shit
Keep dropping bombs until the whole world's dead
They said it's all been done and it's all been said
They'll turn this message into a pop movement
A fashion statement, call it politics
You can mark my words they'll put a spin on it
They say it's all been done

Look outside the box my friend
You heart's been dead since who knows when
It seems we've missed the mark
Lost all hope and given in
Pack up the suitcase
Take that handkerchief and wipe off your chin
The fear that drives you
Needs to be stopped


Fell into a daze
And found my mind was gone and laid to waste
A battle ground indeed
Where holy wars have taken place
I saw the sun set watched it travel down
And tear through the ground
The hate that drives us
Needs to be stopped"

Early in the morning
Rise to meet the sun
Work so hard to feed your wife
No time to show her love
And in the madness of the evening
With diamonds in your hand
Came home an hour early
Caught her with another man

It's always something before the late night
Around the corner, there's always something waiting for you
Can't hold the hands back, can't make the sun rise
It's always something, you know it's always something

On your way back home again
A good samaritan
You see a man stuck in the rain
Stranded with no friends
And from the goodness of your heart
You saved him from the flood
A couple miles down the road
He's covered in your blood

It's always something before the late night
Around the corner, there's always something waiting for you
Can't hold the hands back, can't make the sun rise
It's always something, you know it's always something

Moving around, you never see it coming
Burned by the light you thought that you were running
Blinded again, you're floating like a feather
Why can't you see you can't control the weather?

Sometimes, I caught myself looking in the mirror
With my eyeballs out and I'm looking at the fear
In the bottom of the drain, saw it growing like a plant
But it never works out the way I wrote it in my hands

Some people say that I've gone mad

I got to go down to the school house
And, and get some shoes
And get the right haircut
And the shoes, and, and, and...
The right haircut, the right haircut

Yea yea yea yea yea yea
So cool, yea

We turn our heads and cover our faces
Now flames devour the sky
And I hear these words in the back of my mind

Here we stand at this fork in the road
We've got no time to waste, oh which way shall we go
Is the world spinning out of control
Which way shall we go, which way shall we go
I can't believe this, it makes me sick

Fresh smell of death on your tongue
You bait the hook and here come the children
Another grave stone to sell
While you get rich in the valley of Hell

Here we stand at this fork in the road
We've got no time to waste, oh which way shall we go
Is the world spinning out of control
Which way shall we go, which way shall we go
I can't believe this, it makes me sick

The devil's creeping, he's got us eating from his dirty hands
We feast on lies which makes it hard for us to take a stand
Out in the desert there's a forest full of fallen trees
It's what they want but, no, it's not what we need


Screaming at the ceiling doesn't make it better
Slipped into a coma, lost my favorite sweater
Ask them no more questions you'll never catch them lying
It's time to make our move and strike them right between the eyes

Here we stand at this fork in the road
We've got no time to waste, oh which way shall we go
Is the world spinning out of control
Which way shall we go, which way shall we go"

Close my eyes and let the lovelight guide me home
Let the lovelight guide me home
Let the lovelight guide me home"
