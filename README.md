- Semantic similarity in lyrics. Logan, Kositsky, and Moreno investigated the use of lyrics to automatically identify and categorize music, as well as to detect artist similarities. The song lyrics were gathered from several websites. To analyze the content and semantics of the lyrics, techniques such as PLSA (Probabilistic Latent Semantic Analysis) and the k-means clustering approach were applied. The system's similarity is determined by mixing it with another sound system. There are pros and downsides to both approaches utilized. As a result, a combination of the two strategies would almost certainly be far superior, but that is something for future research.
